051-1,"#051-1 ""My wife to be"" and I were in a store. Apparently the store was near the water because I kept on trying to convince her to drive the boat while I went skiing. She claimed it was too cold to ski. Besides she had to buy snap-together funnels at the store near the water. In the store she was wearing only a towel, and I was holding the towel on her for a while so that she could look for funnels. She passed up quite a few funnels until she got to the snap-together ones. Finaly I got to go waterskiing, but it wasn't my ""wife to be"" driving the boat. It was my sister. But before my sister took me waterskiing, back in the store with my wife, after she bought the funnels we moved onto a different area of the store. We came across a table. On that table were the workout gloves (2 pair) one mine, one my sister's, that she and I had lost in real life. In the dream they were new and didn't have all the holes and stuff in them as they did when we lost them. I told my ""wife to be"" about how comfortable the gloves were and where the holes were and how they fit and how I wish I still had those gloves. I remember hoping that my ""wife to be"" would get the hint and buy the gloves for me for Christmas.",college-m.tsv,,-0.05532667,-0.11353087,0.1356268,-0.25061345
055-4,"#055-4 My friend (Joel) and I were in a big house. There were four young girls playing somewhere in the house. These girls were approximately ten or eleven years of age. At first Joel and I were just watching the girls socialize in the backyard. They were congregated around the swimming pool with what looked like dolls. Anyway, we went back in the house, where the girls were playing in several rooms while Joel and I were watching TV downstairs. Suddenly, we heard several knocks right above us. We figured out that the father was coming downstairs. As soon as he made his way down the stairs Joel hesitantly took off running. I followed him outside until we were not in clear view: He then (desperately) asked me to call a cab from the payphone in the backyard. He told me of a party that was going on that night. He suddenly flipped me a coin but I didn't react to it quickly enough. He flipped me a second coin as if he were James Dean. I proceeded to call the cab and I woke up as soon as it arrived.",college-m.tsv,,-0.016172113,-0.2732611,-0.16867028,0.11772755
058-1,"#058-1 My friends and I were supposed to go to Boston one night, around 6 or 7 pm. The train was the last one that night, even though the last one is usually at 11:00. For some reason, the train was leaving from my old high school bus stop. Everyone was meeting at my house, which is about a two-minute ride from the stop. They were at my house, but I was really late. This is very unusual, because I'm always early. They were in my kitchen and kept telling me to hurry, as I was. We decided that they'd leave and I'd meet them at the bus/train stop. Now, there's only a couple of minutes 'til the train's departure. I raced out of my house, down the stairs and across the lawn, but I forgot my pants. I ran back, put them on, and ran out again, but forgot my asthma medicine. To make a long story short, I forgot my wallet and my coat, and ran back and forth every time for each item. Eventually, I got to the street, knowing there was no way I could make the train. Then my friend's car drove over the hill to meet me. The car was red, even though I don't know anyone with a red car. They stopped next to me, and they looked disappointed. Then I woke up.",college-m.tsv,,-0.095523186,-0.2461072,0.14650162,0.12906945
083-3,"#083-3 I was on the phone with my girlfriend and we got into a huge argument. She was in her kitchen talking on the phone, where her father and mother were. She was crying on the phone, in front of her parents because of the argument. Her parents asked her what was wrong and if she were all right. She said she was fine; nothing was wrong. When I went over to her house the next night, she stepped out of the room for a minute and her father came in to talk to me for a minute. He said if I ever get into another argument and get her upset again, like she was before, he would never let me see her again because of all the stress I would be causing her.",college-m.tsv,,-0.17029305,-0.078019254,-0.13842362,-0.026638089
087-3,"#087-3 I was mowing my lawn. The strange thing is my yard was totally different than the real world. There were vast areas of grass, [illegible] wire fences separated each person's property. The houses were far apart from each other. It was also a bright sunny day. I was mowing my lawn and so were the neighbors. But I noticed that they were starting to get hostile. I stopped and saw the two neighbors upsetting each other. The blades of grass and other small particles were flying into each other's lawns due to the mowers. Before it got too ugly, I woke up.",college-m.tsv,,-0.059593663,-0.051900942,0.13981031,0.17270468
095-1,"#095-1 I had a dream last night that I was at work and a man came in and wanted a sandwich. (I work at a deli.) He asked for a hamburg sub, like the one at DeAngelo's. We don't sell those. I found a little bit of hamburger anyway. So I then started to cook it in the microwave. We usually only cook pastrami in the microwave. I put pastrami in with the hamburg. The weird thing was that when everything was still cold and before I put it in the microwave the cheese that I put on it was melted already. Then I asked the guy, who looked like he was part of the Hell's Angels, if he liked the cheese melted and he wanted to know why it was melted before I cooked it. Then he asked me how much hamburg I put in. I showed him the little bit I had put in. (We put things in a dish when we cook in microwave.) Then he said that I should charge him less. I told him I put pastrami in it also so it would be the same price. Then he got upset. I was nervous when getting everything ready and I took out a hot dog roll to put the sandwich in but he said he wanted a sub roll. Then another customer wanted something at the lottery so I went over to take care of that person. There were all these people at the counter. My cousin, who does not work there, was behind the counter and I could not squeeze by him because he was too fat. Then I started panicking and getting real nervous. Then I woke up.",college-m.tsv,,-0.023106745,-0.16357866,-0.15752769,-0.12874457
097-3,"#097-3 We were off Admiral Street sitting on a house that has been known to have drugs deals there. There were at least two patrol cars that I could see. I was alone in one. I went into the house and arrested various people, but the one I caught happened to be my sister. I did not know what to do. Do I arrest her or let her go? She had just had a baby in February. I arrested her because it was my obligation and it was the best thing for her. I then became scared that the court would take away her baby, but I would file for custody.",college-m.tsv,,-0.14232168,-0.09732966,0.15055688,0.16344088
098-4,"#098-4 My friend Paul and I were at a convenience store. These two guys came into the store. There was an argument between them and us. Outside the car one of the guys came up to my window and started screaming and waving a gun. I took off with Paul and they chased us. After a couple of minutes into the chase I got a flat tire. Paul and I said that if we split up it would be harder for them to chase us. I ended up running to the fire station where my father was working that night. He took me up to the third floor. All of a sudden we both saw one of the men trying to get at us from outside as he was trying to get in through the window. Once he got into the room I ran right into him causing him to fall right through the window. I thought I had killed him, but I looked out the window. He had only fallen into a hedge that was out on the second floor. As my father and I looked over he was pulling out a gun. I ducked and my father was one second short of ducking and ended up getting hit in his right side of his ribs. I picked my father up on my shoulders and carried him throughout the fire station. I was very aggravated because of what had happened so I hid my father in the fire station, got an axe off of the fire truck and went looking for this person. As I was retracing my tracks the stupid phone rang -- woke.",college-m.tsv,,-0.15472208,-0.3239266,-0.06462419,0.34660214
100-4,"#100-4 I was being detained in a kind of prison in a former communist country in central Europe. The prison was in Europe, but it was designed exactly like Fenway Park in Boston. I was being held along with a group of students, but why we were being detained was unknown. Apparently we were found guilty of some crime that nobody seemed to understand. Groups of us were sequestered into various locations throughout the prison. The conditions of the cells were very primitive. They were large rooms with cement floors that were covered with straw. Upon arrival at the prison, our clothes had to be traded in for very worn, loose-fitting outfits that were tied at the waist with ropes. The prison, being the actual size of Fenway Park, seemed very large. There were very few people around except for ouselves and prison officials. While we were unable to go outside of the prison, we were permitted to move around inside of it. The halls and passageways were relatively empty, but there were people working at the concession stands. At one point the other prisoners and I decided I should attempt to buy some beer at one of the concession stands. I found a beer stand and asked if I were allowed to purchase some beer. I reached into my pocket and found money that I could pay for it with. The attendant replied that I could buy some beer if I hadn't had any codeine within the last 20 hours. I remembered that the prison officials had given me some medications earlier that day with codeine, so I was not able to have the beer. At that point I began walking around in the large and desolate prison. I remember nothing further about this dream.",college-m.tsv,,-0.18254203,-0.029761776,0.26033866,0.021469565
3,It is summer. I'm still living as a single mom on Lakeland. My family lived on the same street. I saw Brian F go in their house dressed in his underwear and a man's pink negligee with a girl on each arm. He leaned out the window and invited me in but I said no. I was in my house looking out the window and could see one of the neighbor's home movies. It was a little boy by a fence learning to play baseball. He is batting but he keeps missing. The little boy was Connie's son. I then went to Connie B's house. Their whole family was there. One of the men said I was his. I was interested in his brother. We were all talking and laughing. I felt that they really liked me. I was the life of the party. We were discussing swimming pools and hot tubs. The man I was interested in was with two women. He said the image of me in a swimsuit was gross. I became very quiet and sad. I left and went to my family's house. I made a comment about them living on the same street and never coming to see me.,elizabeth.tsv,(1991-01-31),-0.2185525,-0.26092786,-0.17011009,-0.00377422
12,"I was babysitting for Matthew and Michael A, but I had to prepare for a show. The show or meeting was to be held at my mother's hometown at a VFW hall. I was having trouble getting ready while babysitting. I asked Aunt P and Aunt H to babysit at their house. They agreed. A short time later, they showed up with Michael A. They were having a difficult time with him. He said he wanted to see me for a little while. A short time later, I went outside to take him back and they were sitting in the driveway waiting. Later, when I left to check on them, they were in the driveway again. This time Aunt J was with them and a fourth person I can't identify. They were having a lot of trouble with Michael A. The fourth person was finally able to pacify him. She gave me directions to the meeting. I went to my meeting. Theresa Ah had made some suggestions for my meeting and the signs. The meeting room was much smaller than I had expected. There were no signs, but the room was full of people. I was supposed to dress as a man. I was only half dressed. I took Michael A back to Theresa Ah and didn't tell her what a problem he was.",elizabeth.tsv,(1993-02-28),-0.30141696,-0.050303243,0.044636507,0.00024750934
19,"I was visiting Matthew's school and as I was walking around the premises there I ran into Bill F. I was very surprised. Quite shocked, honestly. He had never been there before. I didn't know that he was coming up here to visit. I didn't know that he even knew where the school was so I was very surprised to find him there. We were sitting at the school watching traffic go by. We could see a playground from where we were sitting. As we were sitting there, I realized that we were moving. We were both sitting but somehow we were moving. We finally got up and walked back to where we were and walked back then to my car. We were talking about he was there. He expressed a lot of frustration with Daddy. He made some comments about the possibility of moving out. With some hesitation, I suggested to him that Brian F leave Chantelle F and that he and Brian F move to Indy, buy a house, and live together. Then I suggested, hesitantly, that maybe he should spend two weeks with me as kind of a trial period. It would help me out. He could pay me some rent. He could be there for Matthew when I'm not. It would be a good situation for me too. We should do it on a trial basis. While we're talking, we're driving back to the apartment. When we get to the apartment, I go in and realize that I had been robbed. It's somewhat odd, the things that they took. The living room was completely cleaned out. There was nothing left in there. I went in the kitchen and the refrigerator was gone. I remember thinking that I would have to replace the refrigerator as well as all my food. The dryer was gone but not the washer. My apartment had a window air conditioner and they had taken that out of the window and set it on the floor. I went into my bedroom and the only thing that was gone out of my bedroom was my bed. When I came back into the living room, Bill F and Matthew were standing there waiting for me. Bill F commented that something just didn't feel right. At that point, I realized that I didn't check the bathroom. I went to check the bathroom and the door was closed. I opened it without thinking first. There was somebody in my shower. I quickly closed the door and we ran out of the apartment and ran next door to a neighbor called Pop. Pat C and some friends were in her apartment doing laundry and I asked if I could use her phone to call the police. She, of course, let me. I called the police. I don't remember the conversation. After I hung up I went back into the apartment because I thought he would be gone by now. Just as I opened the apartment door, Bill F and Matthew were behind me; this huge man was standing there. I yanked the apartment door closed and as I held it closed, I waved Bill F and Matthew back into the neighbor's apartment. I let go, ran into the neighbor's apartment, and locked the door. This burglar came out of my apartment. He was slamming against the neighbor's door trying to get it open. He finally did get it open. He said he was just looking for a place to take a shower. He didn't say anything about all the things that were gone or missing. He asked if I would rather if he came in there and finished his shower. I said no, no. I pushed him out. I watched and he had trouble getting out of the actual building. He went ahead and left. I started to think that insurance would take care of everything, but then I realized I had no property insurance. How could I get my property insurance reinstated if I file a report, or how could I get my insurance back and then make the claim and still have everything covered by insurance. I started thinking about the morality of that and thought that wasn't right for me to do that. I'll just have to suffer the lost. I also started wondering if friends or family would take up money to help me. How would I replace my lost things? I could get the new bedroom suite that I had been wanting for a long time. Just different odd things like that. The other thing that I remember about the dream that I find very odd, both that it was in the dream and that I remember it was that when I was in the neighbor's apartment there was a cat in there, standing on it's hind legs, urinating into a bowl. I remember the neighbor moving the bowl a little so the cat didn't urinate on the carpet.",elizabeth.tsv,(1995-11-03),-0.29501247,-0.1348481,-0.33875552,0.17769393
20,"Doctor Pi and I were in a room talking about some of my course work. He started to leave. As he started to leave, I began to get undressed. He turned around and came back in. I had taken off my nightgown and was now holding it up against me to keep myself covered. He made some comment about my not having anything on. I told him I thought he was leaving, that was why I did it. He went on to make some comment about what people on campus would say or do if we were personally involved. He said something about getting fired and then something else I don't remember about it being risky. I said, maybe I don't mind the risk! He just looked at me kind of odd and half-smiled then left. The next thing I knew we were in a bedroom, still talking about my classes. I was lying in bed covered with a blanket but had no clothes on. Doctor Pi was sitting on the bed beside me with his back to me, though he was leaning against me, and he had one hand on me I must have said something to him about being worried because he said, yeah, I'm scared too. Then he smiled reassuringly. Students kept coming in to ask him questions. I was worried about this but it did not seem to bother him.",elizabeth.tsv,(1997-05-12),-0.12853901,-0.23450668,-0.3245053,-0.08901226
21,"I was with Bill F at SMW. We were trying to see where Doctor Pi lives. We went in this large building. It looked like a combined office and storage space. Everything was a mess. There were many different rooms. Each room had many different things in it. no boxes. but things sitting out piled on tables and such. I finally looked into one room and I saw Doctor Pi. He was sitting with his back to me, watching TV and combing his hair. Bill F and I walked away and looked into this big double-door closet. I don't remember what was in there. Suddenly Doctor Pi saw us. He seemed a bit embarrassed at his living arrangements. He said that most of his money goes to child support so he couldn't afford much in terms of a place to live. The next thing I remember is he saying that he loves me and wants to marry me. I replied that I love him to and that I accept. We talked a bit about Matthew and about Belle.",elizabeth.tsv,(1997-05-13),-0.21411589,-0.040391155,-0.41820914,-0.13967353
22,"I came to the store and Nicki T was working. She said nothing to me but was working on wearing a cordless phone, which was made to fit into a carry bag of sorts that was to be worn over the shoulder. The base with the numbers was carried in the back part and the speaker/receiver in the front. She was working closely with a sales associate named Nicki T. I reminded her that the phone is only for the store manager and store business. She just shrugged her shoulders. I took her into the back room of the store to talk with her about the apology and other related things. This wasn't our real backroom. It looked like the backroom of the drug stores where I used to work. We were sitting across from each other at a 6ft. table. As we were talking someone just appeared sitting in a chair next to me. I did not recognize her. She told me she was an angel. She was a large woman with very long, permed, light brown hair, which she wore parted in the middle and hanging straight down. I asked Nicki T if she saw her and Nicki T said yes. I asked why she was here and she said to help me. One of the first issues I began talking to Nicki T about was doing markdowns the correct way. I told her she had to do the items in the backroom as well. She wanted to know why and explained to her that was the only way for those things to be correctly priced when they went to the sales floor. As I was explaining this, I saw the section of the backroom where all baby products were stored. I remember seeing baby powder and Vaseline in particular but there was a long row of such products. We then went on to the way she is managing the sales associate Nicki T and the example she sets. She had been trying to keep Nicki T away from me. I reminded her that she is not the store manager, she cannot keep employees from me, and she must set a good example for the staff. She gave me the look she always does when she gets an attitude and said something but I don't know what. I asked the angel how I was doing and she said fine, patted me on the arm, and smiled reassuringly. Four new people appeared. A man, women, a girl, and a boy. I did not know them and asked them who they were. They, too, said they were angels there to offer me their support. They patted me on the shoulder and then said hello to the other angel touching her on the shoulder. They remained standing directly behind me and the other angel. I asked Nicki T if she saw them and she said yes. Someone else walked by and I asked them the same thing and they said yes. I wanted to reassure myself that I wasn't just seeing them because I wanted to. I ended my conversation with Nicki T by saying I wasn't going to put up with anymore. I told her that even though it might make my life much more difficult at least temporarily that the next time she screwed around with policy I would terminate her. She acted as though she didn't believe me and I told her she better, because I would. She left the room. I turned to the first angel, the others were now gone though I don't remember them leaving. I asked the angel how she thought I did and she said I did the right thing and I had done fine. I asked her how God thought I did. She said I didn't need him to tell me that. I said but I want to know that he thinks I did the right thing. She said she would ask him, she closed her eyes, within seconds she had a smile on her face. Then she chuckled a little. When she opened her eyes, she said he wants me to ask when I need help but other than that, I don't need his constant reassurance on matters like this. After this was over, I called my friend Jennifer K to tell her about my angel experience. I was so excited that I had an angel encounter. We talked about it a bit but I don't remember any of it. The next thing I knew I was in a large office, supposedly of the company where I work but the surroundings were not familiar to me. A lawyer approached me and said he was representing the sales associate Nicki T. I told him he would have to wait for a few minutes before I spoke to him. I knew I needed to try to get in touch with a company representative before talking to an attorney. I remember asking some of the office workers why Nicki T would need or want an attorney and what were going on because I didn't feel that I knew what was going on. None of them knew what had happened that she would have an attorney either. We were trying unsuccessfully to find a corporate person to give me approval to talk with the attorney or to provide our own attorney. Nicki T's attorney asked me why I felt I needed an attorney present to talk with him. I replied that it was not wise for me to speak with an attorney regarding company business without consulting our own company attorney first. As I was looking for our company attorney or human resource person or someone I said perhaps I should go to the sister company office next door and see if someone there could help. The office staff at my office did not know whom I would talk to there so they were trying to find out. While I was waiting, I went into one of the back offices. There were quite a few other people in this room. I was told that everyone in there was being punished by being put on a game show. One of the people in the room was actor/director Ron Howard. He had put on several different costumes and was required to do comedy routines in each one. He was with two other people in each of these routines. The final routine each of the two people he was with was required to light a huge firecracker of sorts. One person lit his on the top and it sparked a bit and then fizzled. The other lit his from the bottom and it shot off into the air. Someone said that is what you were supposed to do with them, so the first guy lit his at the bottom and it took off into the air. Both firecrackers were flying around the office in and out of hallways and doors. I crouched to the floor to avoid being hit. Someone said that was the whole purpose of lighting them, to avoid being hit by them.",elizabeth.tsv,(1997-06-15),-0.3079364,-0.061282214,0.10764485,-0.13339029
23,"My mother and my son had both said some things about John Davidson, unpleasant and untrue, and they had started to spread as rumors. One of them, the one my son said, had actually been printed as a headline in a newspaper. John was in our town one day and so we told them they had to talk with him and tell him what they said, that they were responsible for it and to apologize to him. My mother did it. My son also did it. He said he wanted me to be with him when he did. Shortly after, I saw him sitting down at a table with John so I went over to join them. When I got there all of the seats were taken by many of Matthew's friends and John. I asked Matthew if he still wanted me there. He said, well, since I didn't ask you to be here in the first place. He started laughing and looking at his friends. I slapped his check, not too hard but hard enough to sting. I told him that's what he gets for lying and I walked away. I was walking through the town looking at the houses as I walked. I came upon several houses that had black wrought iron shelves on the back outside walls. They were on rollers, kind of like the roller ladders you see by high library shelves. I was commenting on how much I liked those. I was thinking about buying one of those houses. I heard that John was interested in this particular house. I remember thinking that perhaps John and I would get together then. Somebody standing near me asked me if I had seen the fifth floor of the house. I remember looking up at it for the first time and counting the floors. I only saw four so I thought it must have a basement. They took me inside to show me the fifth floor. When I went inside to see the fifth floor, I was suddenly a teenage girl accompanied by my mother and a girl friend. As we went through the house I noticed how old it was, and that it needed a lot of remodeling but I thought how fun that would be. I also noticed the floors were all hardwood and in very bad shape. I thought about the stripping and refinishing that would be needed. When we came to the fifth floor, there were two rooms. The first room was a nicely decorated dining room. It seemed as though there might be a kitchen off the dining room, but I did not see it. The table was set for a meal and in fact there were two people sitting getting ready to eat and they had food on their plates. A third person emerged through a door with more food, perhaps a turkey. It seemed as though they were preparing to celebrate a holiday meal and that they were expecting us for dinner. They asked us to join them. The person who emerged with the food was a blonde, pretty woman perhaps in her early 40's. The next thing I know, we are still in the house. I see the housekeeper, a black, heavyset woman, looking very sad as though she will not be needed here any longer. The next thing I see she is putting two children to bed. She is lying in bed with them to tell them a bedtime story. The one child is very small, perhaps one year old or less. The other appears to perhaps be near the age of three. At this moment, I get the sense that I am the older child, though I am watching this happen and I am still in the same house. We then go to see the other room of the fifth floor of this house. There is nothing in the room except a ladder that leads to a very dark area, maybe another room or attic? My girlfriend and I are alone so we decide to climb the ladder and see what is up there. I don't know how we manage but we seem to both be near the top of the ladder looking into this area. It is indeed an attic. It has a lot of stuff in there that we think looks so cool! There is something almost right in front of us that is covered by a cloth. We remove the cloth and are startled to find it is a very small gorilla, about the size of a monkey. The gorilla only moves slightly, looks directly at us, but makes no sound. We cover it again quickly. We debate whether we should go into the attic and look around. We think we shouldn't but we go anyway. We are too curious and really want to look at some of this cool stuff up here. We are now walking through several rooms of the house talking about what it would cost to redecorate and how we can come up with a budget. I am wondering how I would go about this. I want to have a decorator come in. I am still with my girlfriend. We are making a list of what we would need to do in each room. Wallpaper, curtains, wall plate covers, paint, throw pillows, and bedspreads. We go into another room and do the same thing. One room had a bed in it that had a bedspread on it. There may have actually been two beds. I also saw some baskets and throw pillows that I liked but I thought they were the wrong color. They are what prompted me to add throw pillows to the list for redecorating. The baskets were somewhat attached to the throw pillows and I saw some type of rings or large hoops, also attached. We are back in the attic now, looking at things from two perspectives. One was just the curiosity of seeing what was there and the other perspective was to see if there were things that we could use in the house when we redecorate. I found this straw purse. I'm not sure it was a purse. I commented that it would be really neat to have on a dresser and have scarves flowing out of it. My girlfriend told me to go for it. I can't remember much else of what we found. There were many cats around. I remember thinking of my allergy to cats but it did not bother me enough to make me leave. The last thing we found was a book about three people. I think they were trapeze artists or perhaps circus performers. They were two men and a woman. The woman was in the middle of the picture. We wondered if the woman in the picture was the owner of the house. Just at that time, my mother was at the bottom of the ladder telling us we shouldn't be up there and especially not going through those things. As she was reprimanding us, the owner of the house appeared. She didn't seem particularly upset that we were up there. She seemed somewhat sad, and that she wanted to explain some things to us. I get the feeling that she was going to tell us that she was in fact that woman, that the gorilla was a gift/reminder of that time, and that she just couldn't bear to part with it because of that. I also get some sense that the gorilla was in this attic and covered up because if anyone found out she had it, it would be taken away by the zoo or some such authority. I also some sense of something about her feeding it everyday.",elizabeth.tsv,(1999-01-17),-0.23882014,-0.10154389,-0.18654072,0.07422948
25,"I was Robin Williams. All three of the children from the movie were there and they were my children. We were riding in an airplane. I don't know why. We were in something like a cargo compartment where we couldn't see the pilot. The pilot may have been flying us down, but I'm not sure. We were all holding on trying to help. It was as if the plane wasn't going to make it all the way over. So we tilted to one side to help the plane go over. As it started to go over, we ran to the other side to help it balance. I don't know what happened. The older daughter and I were outside the airplane. There like bars on the outside that we were hanging onto. I remember having a real close look at the feet of the older daughter. She spent her time putting her feet in a place where she would be able to keep holding on. I realize I am somewhere else, and all three of the children have died in that flight. Somehow, I survived. It was just killing me. I was just dying inside. There was this conveyor belt. All of the children's clothes are coming down a conveyor belt all clean and pressed. clothes that they had on in their accident. It's just killing me that they all died. I just thought I was going to die. I thought I was going to die from the pain. It hurt so badly. The next thing I know I'm in my house and I'm myself again. A friend of mine from high school, Freda L, showed up. She came in my house. She was holding something like a postcard like the ones sent out for Tupperware parties and such. I guess I was having some kind of party like that or selling something like that. It wasn't Tupperware but I don't know exactly what it was. Freda L had come over to give me her order. There is a bunch of people around but I don't know why and I don't know any of them. I don't know if they were all women or if they were both men and women. We went outside and there were people outside too. Some of them were in water. It seemed to be more like a pond than a swimming pool. At that point, it seems that the people were both men and women. Freda L was in the pond now. I asked her if I told her about Darren. She said, no. I told her that he died last week. She went under water and didn't come back up. She was okay. She was under water because she was crying and didn't want anyone to see her. Then, another high school friend, Dorothea D, was there. She wanted to know what was wrong with Freda L. Someone said to her that Anna told her that Darren died last week. Dorothea D said, do you mean the Darren that used to be on Bewitched? I said no, my Darren. Many people were very sad, and so shocked by the news. All I could think about was how terrible I felt about my children dying. I was in so much pain over losing my children. I was having a conversation with God. He assured me that they spent a few seconds being very, very scared but that he went to them and he talked to them, answered their questions, and gave them comfort. They died on impact so they didn't feel any pain. Because he went to them and answered their questions, they weren't scared anymore. While we were having this conversation, I was starting to wash down the inside walls of this baggage compartment or whatever it was that we were in. I was trying to make it all smooth. It was black. There was all this water in it. I think the plane crashed into the water and they died. I don't know why I didn't or how I got out of it. I had like a rag or sponge and dipping into the water and then without wringing it out I would take it to the top of this wall and wash this wall down where it would be smooth and black with no marks on it. I wasn't successful. I just kept doing it. There kept being streaks.",elizabeth.tsv,(1999-08-23),-0.14588384,-0.13370983,0.20602135,0.1558514
26,"Matthew was spending the night with Michael A and Theresa Ah. I don't know why he was spending the night with them. She asked me to watch their baby. They had a baby about 4-5 years ago, shortly before we saw them the last time. I told them I would watch the baby for them. I put her in the front seat of the car with me. I didn't have a child car seat. I just sat her up in the seat. I think she was maybe less than but close to a year old. I buckled her in under the seat belt. Theresa Ah seemed to think that was fine. She didn't say anything about it anyway. Now I am walking somewhere, to my destination, but I don't know where that was. I still have the baby, but I have her in something like a lunch bag. I don't think I am carrying anything else. For some reason I am coming down a back road. As I am coming down this back road there is a car headed right straight at me. It's driving on the wrong side of the road. They don't have their headlights on. Eventually I can get over and it misses me. I see that it is a very beat up police car. I keep going and the same thing happens again. Only this time the lights are on, on the other car. It's another police car, but this time it isn't banged up. The next thing I know I'm still headed for my destination but now I'm walking. As I turn this bend, 5-6 men in black jump out. They are in kind of a six-sided formation; I don't know exactly how to explain it. They are all in black and they all have guns. They take a pose, kind of like something you would see in a movie. It scared me. I turned around and tried to walk as fast as I could the other way. I didn't want to run because I didn't want to scare the baby. I didn't want to hurt the baby. The men quickly overtake me. There are police officers who tell me that there are terrorists, out there that they are trying to capture. They escort me to a main section where I can walk. They tell me that I should be fine as long as I stay in this main area. It's a very public area, kind of like walking along an outdoor mall. As I'm walking I keep coming to these cement ponds. They have small cement strips that you can walk on very carefully to get around the water parts without going out to a main street or anything. I'm walking along these strips, I see some bushes or something like that, and I meet two young girls coming the other way. I very carefully manage to pass them. I keep going and then I meet these girls again. This is odd because I thought they were going the other way before. I manage to catch just a part of their conversation. One of them is trying to decide whether to go to college or whether to work. I see as I go by one of them that there is a very small evergreen tree in a big cement flowerpot. I see falling through that, by these girls, something that looks like a tampon. I keep walking and I come to a place where there are these rooms. There is this couch, some furniture sitting outside one of the rooms. This couch is turned with its back towards me. There is a man sitting in the couch. It is James C. I know Brandy C is inside. I don't know why I know it but I do. There is a chair facing the couch, on the outside also, and Matthew is sitting in there. I don't know why he is with them or how he got there. I said something to James C about gunmen. I said that no, they said we would be safe as long as we stayed on these main streets. Matthew didn't say anything. He was sitting there with one leg over the arm of the chair and reading a magazine. I don't know where I am or who I'm talking to. I'm telling some people about the gunmen. I was reassuring them. They were concerned about the safety of the baby. I opened the lunchbox to the show them and myself that she is okay. I told them what the police said and that they assured us that we should be fine as long as we stayed on these main streets. I continue trying to reassure them that we are safe where we are but they don't want to believe me. They want to take off running because this helicopter is hovering overhead. They are telling us that as long as we stay in the general area where we are we will be fine. These people were panicking. They were running all over the place trying to get out. Now, I'm in this room. It almost seems like an overhead, some kind of a room where you can look out and down out these glass windows. I'm feeling calm and safe because the police told me that if we stayed there we would be safe. However, there are all these other people inside and out, running all over in a panic. There are many people milling around. Everyone is calm down. The baby is fine. I'm not worried about her. All of a sudden, I see something like a baseball record, or being safe, like 5 out of 6 times. For some reason the ration seems like 60 out of 1. The father of this baby comes up to me. It looks like he is discussing with the same person that I am standing with about our safety. I try to reassure him that we are perfectly safe where we are. He doesn't seem to want to go for it. He wants some kind of lessons now on protecting himself. I don't know what kind of lessons. They are trying to reassure us. They have some kind of a metal that's digging into me because of being six and one. I tell him he could use the same thing, but he is too panicked and wants to run. All the while, I know that the baby is safe. We were in front of my apartment here. I don't know if I have the baby with me or not. I'm putting something in the back seat of the car. I'm still assuring whoever is with me that we are going to be safe. I notice a water bottle in the back seat of the car. I think I want to get it out. I don't want them to have that.",elizabeth.tsv,(1999-08-23),-0.18543579,-0.20821567,0.028809557,0.30742744
27,"I was driving somewhere. I don't remember where. I was driving around. I drove into a mall parking lot. I was blocked by a truck that was unloading for The Shoe Store. It had the parking lot and driving area all blocked with a huge thing that was attached to the store and to the truck. I don't know how to explain what it was. Some kind of a conveyor belt for them to unload the shoes from the truck into the store. I was debated how to get where I was going then. All of a sudden, they must have been done, because this huge thing started deflating. It started to collapse. It started to go in, like starting at one end and moving towards the store as it deflated. There was nothing under it as it deflated. It just deflated little by little until it was gone or was done deflating. All that was left was like these robot things that were running towards the store. It seems that maybe the robots had been controlling it or were doing something for the store but I don't know what it was. There is something, not sure they are robots, but something with headphones. There was something about Gale W. She died. It was as if I was there to work. I grabbed some headsets. I was playing around with it. Moving it around to adjust it to fit me.",elizabeth.tsv,(1999-09-01),-0.12703013,-0.02411175,0.23171204,0.2645167
30,"I believe I was a teacher. I took a group of teenagers, along with another adult that I was working with, to some building. We went inside the building. It was a mess. It was dirty and rundown. There was little if anything inside the large room that we were in. I said this would be great. It seemed to be perfect for whatever we wanted it for. At that time, I don't know that I knew what we were looking for. The teens were complaining and such. We went to work cleaning it up and trying to make it usable. I came back into the room and the teens had done a great job fixing it up. There was furniture, pictures hanging on the walls, etc. I took a microphone and told them how very proud I was of them. I told them that I remembered what it was like to be their age, young, afraid, no one to talk to. I told them to feel free to call me at home anytime if they needed someone to talk to. I then handed the microphone to the other adult but don't remember anything that person said. Finally, I told the teens there would be one rule about this room. That rule is confidentiality. Anything that is said in that room stays in that room. That way they would feel safe discussing anything in there.",elizabeth.tsv,(1999-10-28),-0.22706187,-0.04721064,0.15464646,-0.14361441
31,"I was with three of the women from the Golden Girls, Blanche, Rose and Dorothy. I was working as a character in a theme park. This was no character that I recognize or have heard of before. I'm not even sure that I can describe it except that I was in water. Maybe I was some kind of sea witch, but not really a witch though. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know what I was doing as that character. People were coming through the park. I was doing different things. I don't think I was scaring them. I can't even remember interacting with them. Most of my interaction was with Blanche, Rose, and Dorothy. They seemed to be doing the same thing I was. They were characters. We came into the park as visitors though. We also visited a kind of church. It is a very different kind of church. We went in the church and there were no benches. There were folding chairs. There was like this platform. It was not really like a stage, more like a loft. There were musicians on the loft. The music was not rock and roll but something that would really appeal to young people today. Everyone in there really seemed to be enjoying the music. They passed a plate around for the collection and there was a comment about this kind of music really helping them to draw more people in and to get better collections. There is a large hallway outside. At that time, I realized that the hallway was filled with young people who were drawn in because of this music. They were getting ready to pass the plate around out there for a collection. They said something about this helping them to build the new church and maybe a school. They wanted to increase their collections so that they could build a new church, or school and a home for their priest. I don't know if it was a home for homeless girls, runaway girls. It was some kind of home for young girls.",elizabeth.tsv,(1999-10-28),-0.038872786,-0.037742604,0.1660804,-0.19532843
32,"I was at the sleep center and had on an orange-colored wool suit. I didn't have the jacket on. I had a blouse on and the skirt. The skirt was huge. The skirt was way, way too big for me. I was running around trying to find a very big safety pin to try to pin it. I was showing everyone how big it was on me and we were getting ready for a research meeting. Now, I was looking in the cabinets and different things and I saw these front office things like labels. They were in two different cabinets instead of all being in the same place. I wondered why they were in two different cabinets instead of all being in the same place. Finally, someone handed me a large paper clip to hold my skirt. I tried it but it didn't work so I kept looking. I finally found a safety pin and I pinned it. About that time, I noticed Doctor W standing, kind of off in the distance, talking to some woman that I didn't know. I get the impression that she works there but I don't know who she is. Julie Ca was there. Anyway, Doctor W called me over and started telling me about a research study that we were going to be involved in and this woman was going to be involved in it. He told me in front of her that I really am not very knowledgeable about research and so she is going to be very involved in this study. We were in a conference room sitting at this table. All of a sudden, there were many people there. They were all strangers. There was no one else I knew. There is one lady that he had just told me was going to be heavily involved in the research study. I was sitting next to Doctor W. I was having a lot of trouble hearing the conversation. The study was going to be a drug study. Doctor W said something about me not saying anything, but he didn't say it to me. He said it to everybody else. Everybody started making fun of me. Saying things like, Oh Anna can't speak, and things like that. This initial woman that he told me was going to be very involved asked me something about the study. I said, Well, I don't know. I've never been involved in a drug study. Then Doctor W made some other comment that I thought was inappropriate. It was kind of a put down. I started to stand up to ask him to step outside the room with me because I was going to ask him not to berate me in front of other people. I half stood up, then changed my mind and said, well, for the purpose of this study, I'm just part of the research team, okay? Then I sat back down. The meeting continued. Again, I was having a very hard time hearing people. I was really straining to turn my head, really straining to hear what was being said. A couple other people came in the room to join the meeting. Someone said something about talking about something in particular and they were all joking and laughing and one lady said Oh no, no, not me.",elizabeth.tsv,(1999-11-05),-0.2265676,-0.010380196,0.22865018,-0.08686396
34,"I was with Mike M. There was another woman with us as well. She was a much larger woman than I was. Mike M and I were kissing and cuddling and the other woman was not necessarily watching but it was as though she was waiting to be included. I did not want to include her because of her size. As Mike M and I became more intimate, I became very self-conscious of my own size. Mike M kissed my stomach a couple of times and then got up and walked away. We got into a discussion about my weight. He thought it should be very easy for me to lose weight. I tried to explain to him everything I have tried and just how difficult weight loss is for me. He didn't really seem to understand it. As I was having this discussion I seemed to be seeing these pictures of myself at the same time but I'm not sure exactly how. He didn't see them. In each of these pictures, however I was dressed very scantily and provocatively. In a final one, I am dressed in a different, yet similar outfit that really shows my excess tummy weight. I am thinking to myself that I can't believe I did that. I can't believe my sisters saw this and I realize how awful it looked. I also was very disappointed in Mike M because he has told me in waking life that he doesn't care how heavy a woman is as long as he can get his arms around her.",elizabeth.tsv,(1999-11-13),-0.19901007,-0.1367508,-0.15668108,-0.20397694
40,"Someone was after me, trying to kill me. I believe I was maybe at a college and I was going into a building that was maybe a women's dorm. I went inside and see maybe three or four people that they were trying to kill. First, I was outside and there were many women who were heading into the dorm. We heard shooting. Many of the women ducked to the ground on their knees and were praying. I did that too. I don't know how I made the transition to the inside. The next thing I know, it's as though I've been hung, but not killed yet. I'm suspended from the ceiling. I'm waiting for these people. I think I'm suspended with two or three other women. I can't see them but I have a sense that I was. I'm waiting for the people who want to kill me to come in. When they do, I start swinging, trying to attack them from whatever it was that was suspending me there. The next thing I know I'm no longer suspended. I'm free to roam. I still have this sense that they're trying to kill me. I'm in some lingerie or something but no bottoms on. One of the women that wants to kill me comes in the room and I ask her if she wants to fondle me, thinking that she won't want to kill me then. She says no and leaves. Then I plan how I'm going to get out of there before they come back. I don't remember actually making the plan just that I was going to plan to get out of there before they come back. I was doing some reading for a store report. I make a phone call to ask what I'm supposed to read as a resource to do this paper. I realized as soon as I asked that it was a dumb question because I knew what I was supposed to read. It was a one-page thing that I was supposed to read and then write a paper about it. I felt stupid for having asked. They said, yes, that's what I'm supposed to read to do this paper. Something to do with writing this and then using this writing to present something or teach something. I'm in a line of cars. The car in front of me doesn't have any break lights. We're on a winding hill. It's dark. I almost run into this car in front of me because they don't have any taillights. However, it was almost as though, even those these are cars in front of me, I wasn't in a car. I'm sliding out of control. I don't have the sense that I'm in a car. This seems to replay itself. I see the same thing happen again. I'm back in the dorm. Someone comes in. I say that I'm looking for someone and I say something about this writing essay. One woman chuckled and said, yeah, someone even wondered if that one page was in fact the only reading assignment to write the paper. She asked the rest, if that wasn't ridiculous. I said, well, in their defense, I wondered the same thing myself because it was such a short piece. It seemed that there was more that we needed to read to write the paper about.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-02-05),-0.16419795,-0.27241305,0.1420756,0.13881801

When I took the battery case off, the whole back came off and suddenly the camera was huge. There was someone else there helping me get the battery in, putting the battery cover back on, and then putting the back of the camera on. After I did that, it was a regular small camera again. I wanted to take a picture of these four people. They weren't family. It was two couples. I told them that they each needed to lean towards the middle so I could get them in one picture. I was still in the same place but it was as if I had two rolls of paper towels. I was asking someone about them or joking about them. I got up to leave and took one with me. I asked Bob F.

I climbed over a fence or something because I saw these balls and I thought they might be tennis balls. When I got there, they were croquet balls. Then I found this other thing. It was kind of like a small wood cabinet. It had many balls in it and so I started going through there to see if there was a tennis ball in there.

I put my shoes and socks on. I said oh my gosh, I still have to go find a stethoscope. I ran to the hospital and went to this one room. There were many different kinds of stethoscopes and other things hanging in rows from the ceiling. There were many different colors. I grabbed a stethoscope and something else and put the stethoscope around my neck. I had a clipboard or notebook and went to find someone. I said I know I'm very late and I'm sorry.

Oddly, I was now in bed. He was standing next to the bed, leaned over, and kissed me. We had a brief discussion about what to do about us. My feelings were very ambivalent. I think even more so than my feelings about Barry C. I said something about telling different people, hinting, or insinuating something about their reactions. I then said, what about.

There was an old box of Frosted Mini-Wheat's on the counter, the bite size kind that I eat. I got a new box out of the cabinet. They were the larger ones. As I was pouring them into a bowl, the milk was already in the bowl. He was eating the old ones from his hand. He asked about the difference and I told him the ones he was eating weren't good anymore. He asked me if you are supposed to put them in a bowl of milk. I then got ready to add raisins to it. I told him that I always like to put raisins in my cereal.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-03-25),-0.073129945,-0.09867108,-0.36765617,-0.21132219

I went upstairs, but had to step around food sitting on the steps. I thought I should go offer to help with the party prep. That it would be the right thing to do. People were beginning to arrive. They were talking about Suzie G's meringue. It was in a huge, trash-bag-size pastry bag. Later I went into the kitchen and Suzie was there. Something had happened to her meringue. It was out of the bag, in the sink, and piled high above the top of the sink. I told her I had eggs for her to make more.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-04-03),-0.15058003,-0.029098881,0.21208254,-0.20998977

The man had a stocky build, was balding, grey curly hair, very nice, wore one of those felt, flat type of a hat, but not a beret. He was being very supportive and kind about this being Matthew's first time. When he was done, I gave him a thumb's up, though I didn't think Matthew had done a very good job. As the man was leaving, I tried to find Matthew to see if he would be hurt if I fixed it up a bit for the man but I couldn't find Matthew. I went ahead and ran out to the driveway to make the offer to the man anyway. I had still been in bed and had on a short, spaghetti-strap nightgown. I stood by the man's care with my arms folded across my breasts for this reason. He took me up on my offer and continued to be very kind about the whole situation. I asked the man if he ever thought about shaving the top where he had alot stray hair. I started fixing the rest.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-04-06),-0.20982721,-0.0990838,-0.32528743,0.0733658

People started showing up at my house for a party. When one man showed up, I realized he was the father of the killer. It made me very uncomfortable. I didn't want him there either.

We were having a good time, though it was nothing sexual. Some of the men friends with us came to our room. I decided to go into another room and study for a little while. I had books and papers spread out all over a chair with ottoman, like my black leather on in the living room. I decided it was time to stop studying and get ready to go because we were all going out. I started my shower and got out to get something. When I did, I realized that a couple of the men were waiting to use our bathroom so they could also get ready. I took one of them to our other bathroom so he could use it. The next thing I know I am in the shower and Tom Cu and one of the other men come in the bathroom with me to start getting ready. Tom Cu is upset because Mary Cu said we're all going to be late now. It was my fault because I had waited too long to start getting ready and then tied up the bathroom. I apologized. I got the sense that he wasn't going to stay mad very long. Still, I said, I'm sorry Rick with kind of an attitude. I don't know why I called him Rick.

My view was obstructed and I looked around whatever the obstruction was to see that priest. I had a sense that the other priest wasn't there or was upset. When I did see him, there didn't seem to be anything wrong. I thought he might be slouching in his seat but he wasn't. After Mass, I was speaking with Rosalie C.

77,"I was in a small town, and walking home. I hadn't driven there to save money on gas. I don't remember getting there or why I was there. I think this town was one I passed thorough on my way home. I was trying to get to 91st and A1 Road to the west of my home. This town didn't have a 91st St. This doesn't make sense now, but as I was looking for 91st St I saw 92nd and then 101st St. That's when I realized that they didn't have a 91st St. I saw a man on a street. First, I had asked some kids for directions, but their directions didn't make sense to me. Then I asked the man. carrying a duffel bag. He started to tell me one way to get there, but stopped and gave me different directions. He said this was a strange route but the best one. I would go down these steps, the path would go to the left, then I would take the fourth right. That would take me to A1 Road I was looking for. I didn't ask him why it was odd, but repeated the directions back to him to be sure I had it correct. I started on the path, took the left bend, and was faced with a brick door. I pushed the brick door open only to be faced with a few stairs leading up to another door, but that one wouldn't open. I became a bit frightened that I would be trapped so I turned around to go back and get out. When trying to go back I was faced with several of these brick doors. Each time I became a little more panicky that it wouldn't open. I finally got to the steps. At the top of the steps, boards had been nailed sporadically across the opening. I don't remember them being there when I started. There was an opening large enough for me to get out. I ran into the kids again. They couldn't believe he told me to go through the , don't remember what they called it.] They said that if I waited they would just take me to 91st and A1. They checked with their parents and then we left. Before I met the boys or the man the first time, some of the paths I was walking were covered with snow and ice. I was moving my feet and legs as if I was ice-skating but I didn't have skates on. The path was just slick enough that I could skate with my shoes. While the boys were showing me the way, we came to an ice skating rink. The man and his wife were with us now. As we were going in we all got bagels to eat, with different things on them. They told me to just take some of it with me and leave the rest in this little cubbyhole. It was a shelf that reminds me of corporate mailboxes. They each put theirs in one of the cubbies. One boy said especially ones like his because he had icing on his. I didn't do it. I took all of mine with me. We weren't going to skate. just watch. There weren't many people in the stands. Everyone had his or her bagels and a drink sitting on the bleacher seat in front of them. I sat on a row where everyone else had their bagel and drink and I sat mine behind me on a row where others were sitting. I finally said it was time for me to start the rest of the way home. The man and woman were surprised that I would continue to walk. It was dark now and they insisted on driving me. They asked where I lived and assured me it was not an inconvenience. The boys wanted to ride along. The man and his wife said that they would need to get a paper and pen and write down their parent's phone numbers so they could call first and make sure it was okay.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-04-29),-0.095433645,-0.15132335,0.05639816,0.26295558
87,"I went to what seemed to be the SVSC though it didn't look like it does in waking life. I'm fairly sure that's where I was. When I arrived, Doctor Bl was in the driveway. I said hello. He smiled and was very warm and friendly as always. He seemed to be doing something that prompted me to ask him if he needed help but he said no. I went inside. I came back outside. Doctor Bl was still there. I think that maybe he was changing a tire on his car. I didn't ask if he needed help, but I looked carefully to see what/how he was doing to try to reassure myself that he didn't need help or that I shouldn't ask before going on. I did say good-bye to him. The driveway was black gravel. As went out into the road, I was traveling by foot. I stood. on purpose. on a crucifix. I was barefoot. I was using the crucifix to slide along the road. almost like a skateboard but the crucifix was smaller than my foot. In fact, I wonder how it worked because it seems that my foot would have grazed the pavement. The pavement of the road was black. maybe asphalt. Anyway, the crucifix worked well for the reason that I was using it. As I was moving along, I came to a hill. I didn't stop. I gave myself a last, hard push and started sailing down the hill. As I started down, I realized the trees almost came together as they branched over the pavement and made it very dark.I couldn't see anything except the tree branches and pitch, black darkness. I was gaining speed as I sped down the hill. There was a part of me that thought I should stop or at the very least slow myself to a very, very slow pace since I couldn't see what I was sailing into or didn't know what as at the other end of the hill. I decided to just keep going. I think I sensed that it would be okay. The road ended abruptly into a grassy pasture. The grass was a beautiful green. The pasture was perhaps 4 acres or more. There were many animals. different kinds. Immediately after I found myself kind of dumped into this grassy area, two horses charged me. They were solid black and beautiful. I didn't run or try to get away from them. I felt slightly fearful at first but then decided to just stand there. I don't remember if I did that because I didn't think they would hurt me or if I thought it would be best or if I just decided to stand still and see what happened. As the horses neared me, they ran aside rather than into me. I turned around a bit, viewing the pasture. It was very beautiful. Soon other groups of animals started charging me, but they all did the same thing as the first two horses. There were pigs and rabbits. One of the groups of rabbits that charged me there were 4-5 rabbits. Soon a large group of horses charged me. This time I was frightened and ran away from them. There were a number of buildings on the far edge of the pasture. That's where I headed when I began to run. I can't recall exactly what all the buildings were. I don't remember specifically a house, a barn, etc. I may be missing some details here. When I was around these buildings, I was with some man that I don't know. I don't recall having any interaction with him, unless it was just a few words. I'm fairly sure I didn't know him. I met a woman. She said something to me as if she knew me. I don't remember what she said. Whatever she said made me realize she was Patty U. However, this woman was tall, and Patty U is only one inch taller than I am. Anyway, I also recognized her dislike of me. I wanted to defend myself but didn't. I wondered how she knew who I was but thought that Barry C must have shown her pictures of me. I thought that was odd but also didn't like it that he had. As I was walking. alone now.I came across Barry C. He was very unpleasant towards me. I don't remember much of what he said to me. I said to him just because I want to have sex, you think I want to have children? I think I assured him that I did not. After telling him that, his attitude seemed to change, but he didn't speak again. I sensed that he wanted us to try again to be together. I walked away. I think I was headed home. This is odd because Barry C lives in CHV. As I was walking along the road, I came across another man who gave me directions and suggested I attend a single's event in town. I realized that I was in CHV and wondered if I wanted to meet someone else so far away. I think I decided to go ahead and stop by and just see what it was like.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-06-02),-0.09368352,-0.121823184,-0.0892902,0.19504556

The other 2 people I was with before shot and killed four people in this building because they had found us there when we weren't supposed to be there.

I found four radios and lights that he had left on but he wasn't around. I went out to the porch. There were five or six small children playing with the water hose on the driveway. They were sprinkling each other and had a makeshift water slide. I thought Matthew was with them but when I approached, they dropped the hose and ran away. Matthew wasn't there. There was a pipe protruding from the ground. It had a plastic piece on the end with a kind of screen/filter in it. The diameter was about the size of a quarter. I heard Matthew's voice coming from the pipe. I cupped my hands around the pipe and spoke into it saying, Matthew H, you need to come home right now. I knew he would be embarrassed in front of his friends. I didn't know how else to tell him to come home. I went back inside and lay down on the bed. The radio was on. I felt guilty because there was so much I needed to do. I thought about my prior conversation with Matthew, about how he spends so much time lying around watching TV or playing video games instead of doing other things that he would enjoy more.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-06-16),-0.22414911,-0.1614661,-0.04534803,0.12714428

Two women that I worked for took another female coworker and me to another room to train us on closing out the paperwork and money. I did the paperwork while the other woman counted the money. I had completed some of the papers earlier but had done them partially wrong. I saw that they had used a black marker and crossed out the info that was wrong. It was personal information, like maiden name and such I think. I had to recount the money to verify from the first woman. I had trouble doing that because she had put loose change and bills in with other money so I couldn't count it, but I didn't say anything. She had rolled the other coins but put them in the wrong wrappers so I wasn't sure what I was counting there either.

There was food everywhere, almost as if it was on display just for people to take and eat. Lots of sweets especially. At some point Mother, Bev, and Rachel S were there too. We were mostly playing with Rachel S. Bev had a clip-on ponytail for her that Rachel S wouldn't let us put on her. However, it was very cute. She also had this little pair of eyeglasses, which she also wouldn't keep on. Chris C sold insurance. Once we got to his house, he sat in a wheelchair to make it easier to get around. Even though we didn't talk much, I suggested we get together more often. I was trying to be nice because I felt he was very lonely. He seemed to be appreciative of the offer to get together more often. I told him we had one staircase and then wondered what I was thinking and said we could get by without using it. Again, he seemed happy for the offer. I asked him what kind of insurance he sells so I could refer people to him. He said all kinds. At some point Brian F showed up. He couldn't believe all the food. He wanted some but didn't take any. I very much wanted a cream filled donut, but didn't take one. I did take a snickerdoodle. I didn't want Chris C to see that I had it even though he had told us to help ourselves. When we were getting ready to go, he loaded up this big basket/cart full of food for Bev. The items I remember were three boxes of tea, larger than VCR's. I also asked about his apartment Community to see if it was adults. I told him I was thinking about a new apartment where it would be adults only. As we were leaving in the car I realized I had looked at them once before and didn't care for them.

I started driving home and saw the Catholic Church. It's quite possible in waking life, but I was in TH and CHV. Not sure how to explain except that I was in downtown TH and their church. I was driving through downtown CHV to go meet Barry C. When I saw the church, it had many beautiful stained glass windows. I decided that I had to stop for just a minute. I saw Reagan U and she told me where to park. I was concerned because it didn't seem like an appropriate place but she assured met hat it was and why. Something like, if anyone asks, she would make a certain gesture and they would then understand. She went into the church with me. It was as though five Masses were going on. It was not beautiful inside. I was wondering why I had gone on so to Reagan U about how beautiful it was. On the outside, I had seen these beautiful stained-glass windows. I was looking around inside trying to find them. I decided I needed to go bed because Barry C would be waiting. Reagan U left with me. We were sitting on an open-air vehicle of some kind. A man came running out shouting Good News! Good news! I was saying something like that referring to God. Several other men followed him. They were carrying Mass cups of wine. They approached our vehicle. The first man was short, blonde hair. Later, I realized that is the man Reagan U is secretly in love with. One of the men was Ernest Hartman. I drank from his cup. The next thing I knew I was back in my car trying to figure out how to get to where I was meeting Barry C. I guess I was on a cell phone because he said he was going to double back to Druiz St. to turn on the street that we both needed to be on. Right after that, I crossed over Druiz St. and realized I missed it and had to go back also. Maybe some of this was before the church. I think I got lost and this is when I saw the church. After the church, and back in my car, I saw Reagan U in her car and realized she was going to lead me to where I needed to be. I think I was driving to fast because I had to go over two lanes, into a left turn lane, to keep from rear-ending her. My first thought was how I was going to get back behind her. Then I thought I should just give her an okay sign with my fingers and find it on my own. I also realized Barry C would be wondering where I was since I was taking so long.

There were many people running around. There were plain-clothes police officers running frantically with guns. I crouched into a corner just as a police officer leaned against the wall over me and began shooting. A large group of men approached me, also trying to avoid being hurt, and crouched into the corner around me. We were being attacked by Russians. Some Russians found us and began shooting. It seemed that quite a few of the men around me were hit and some killed. At first, I thought they hit everyone but me and I thought about how there were enough men around me to keep me from being hit. At the same time, it almost seemed as though I had been hit also. I didn't feel any pain or anguish as I might have had I actually been hit. The next thing I know Matthew and I had been captured. We were assigned to sleeping quarters.

There was a child sitting on the edge of the deck making something creepy. Maybe something to look like mice? He was throwing them into the grass below. His mom said that what he was making and doing was very good. I had a very strange looking red tooth and there was a gap all around it. She asked me if it was real. I took it out and you could see it was plastic. It's as if I was looking at my own mouth but I didn't have a mirror. I also know the tooth wasn't real but when I pulled it out and saw it was plastic I guess it confirmed to me that it wasn't real. I put it back on.

He had apparently been practicing working on ears. He had a pair of very long surgical tweezers. He reached in her ear I think, and pulled something out. Then he said, see I can do it. They were sitting in a huge room that was very bright and sterile looking. There were other cars parked in there also. The woman was in the driver seat of this car. She was there to get her ear worked on. Someone came up, opened her car door, took her whole seat out with her still sitting in it and stuck it out the inside of her car door. The door had all kinds of wires and things showing. They put her there to work on her ear. I was in a room with wood floors and walls. The wood looked like what you see in a barn or a very rustic house. A little boy set rat free in the room. In waking life, I would have been very frightened and distraught about this. Here I stood in place and first moved slightly trying to avoid the rat. I hated it, but was trying to stay in control and not let it make me panic or scream.

129,"I was going to Minnesota to give a dream lecture. The company I was working for was sending four other people with me. Two men and two women. They were going along to share driving duties. There was some discussion about how long the drive was and if it was worth it to make the drive to do the dream lecture. It was decided, though I don't think everyone agreed, that it was a 24-hour drive and so we would go. I don't remember actually giving the lecture. At the end of the lecture, all five of us sat around a table, yet all facing the audience, to answer audience questions. I ended up behind some of the others.

That is why I didn't know her phone number. Tom came out and took care of things.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-10-21),-0.014030066,-0.17886297,-0.051751852,-0.12718713
130,"We are out sightseeing in this little town. It is fall, I think maybe late October, like around Halloween. I am with a man named Daniel [unknown in waking life] . He is tall, thin, with blondish-brown hair. He is very kind and yet very strong personally. We have a bunch of children with us. I think we are just sightseeing and such. We see this man sitting in a chair. I think he was playing music. His pants are unzipped and his penis is showing. As I notice it, his erect penis comes completely out of his pants and is laying flat against the chair. Right after this happens something black, reminds me of a worm but it wasn't that, slides down the length of his penis and disappears. I thought it was nasty and wondered what it was. As Daniel, I, and the children are sightseeing, we are participating in lots of local activities. It is a very small town, smaller than St. Joe, where everyone knows each other, gets along well together, and does many fun things together. We join them in some kind of choral concert. We, or the children, are singing with them. I feel more as if I am observing than participating but I'm fairly sure the children were participating. It feels as though Daniel and I are taking an open carriage ride in the early evening, though it is dark. We are talking about how wonderful and beautiful it is there and how great it would be to live there. We talk especially about what it would be like in the winter, with the snow, and at Christmas. It wasn't snowing, the leaves had all turned colors, it was beautiful, and the air was crisp and cool. Yet, I had a very clear picture of the area after a large snow. I could literally see it. I saw a couple of men clearing snow from their cars. One has a shovel and seems to be trying to get snow out from under the front driver's side wheel well. Then I'm back to reality and noticing the beautiful fall colors again. I notice two little tiny people in a tree. One male and one female. They are maybe only two inches tall. I have a sense that I see them and yet at this time I also feel like I might be the female. It may be that the male lives in that tree but the female is just there, visiting. They are somewhat concerned, but not terribly, but something that is happening. The tree begins to shake. A little bit later, Daniel and I are back with the children doing something else. One of the children finds two little flat things lying on the ground. They appear to be the kind of plastic clear and color decals that I put on my windows at Christmas time. These look like the two tiny people. We realize that whatever happened to the tree did this to them, that the two little things, were actually these people and they were now gone for good. It was sad and yet okay both. There is another adult. We called him Cooter. He is in the car with Daniel and a little girl. He said something to the little girl about Uncle Cooter always being there for her. The next thing I know Daniel and I are back home, to my home, with the children. It is a very lovely middle-class home. We try to get all the children into bed. I don't know where Cooter is at this time. I am observing this and yet at the same time feel as though I am the woman. I go to the other end of the house. It seems to be a long house because there seems to be quite a distance between the children's room and my room. Daniel came into my room. I am already dressed for bed in a spaghetti strap satin full-length nightgown. I lay down on top of the blankets. Daniel lies down with me and is holding me. We are discussing him staying there with me. possibly marriage. living with us. I get the sense that the children are foster children. There are a number of boys and I think just one girl. This next part is weird but I will explain as best I can. I suddenly feel as though I am Daniel and that I am holding the woman. I am holding her in a way that my right arm is running parallel to and cupping her legs, buttocks, and back. It's kind of like I am a huge person and at the same time this entire part of her body is the same size as the length of my arm. There is also the sense that I am holding both the woman and Daniel. I think we finally decide that we will give it a go. sharing the home and love of and care for the children. I don't know if that means marriage or simply living together though. It almost seems this is another scene but there is discussion about Cooter and what will happen to him. He doesn't have a place to live. My first thought is to turn a shed in the back yard into a bedroom. I realize then that he would be coming in and out of the house using our kitchen, bathrooms, etc, and we Daniel and I wouldn't have any privacy that way. I suggest that we build him an apartment over the garage.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-10-21),-0.09243545,-0.11288107,-0.20546377,0.028630583
136,"I went to a hotel somewhere to be with Daniel R. While I was there, I realized Aimee F was also there to be with Daniel R. Of course, I was upset. I was in a huge hotel room suite that had two bathrooms. I went into one bathroom and Daniel R was in there taking a bath. I went into the other bathroom and there was someone who looked exactly like him also taking a bath. I realized at that point that he had a twin. While they were in the bathtubs, they were both drinking and smoking cigars. Later I realized he was one of triplets, not twins. I knew now that Aimee F was there for Daniel R's twin. I think we were in Las Vegas. I believe we went to dinner with a group of people. Daniel R sat next to me though he hardly said anything to me the entire time. Even when he did, it was things that sounded like he was making fun of me, as he used to do in waking life. Something happened, maybe Daniel R's comment, that made me realize I did not want to be with him any more. I realized that I deserved better than this. However, I was afraid of what he might do if I tried to leave. So I was trying to figure out a way to sneak out. Aimee F had decided to stay. She thought she could get what she wanted out of the relationship with the twin without doing anything she didn't want to do. There were two other men who worked for Daniel R who were going to help me sneak out. I packed my suitcases. I went into this elevator. I don't remember exactly how this happened but the elevator turned sideways and I slid out rather than stepping out like you normally would. It wasn't dangerous or scary. I just remember thinking how odd it was. As I was leaving, there was a large crowd of people gathered for some event. I saw the top of Daniel R's head but was sure he didn't see me. I went to a car with the one man who was helping me to leave. We put all of my suitcases and things in the back seat. I remember throwing a coat back there too. That man walked away then to find the other man, who was going to drive me to the airport. When that man got there I remember checking the backseat to make sure all of my things were still back there. As we drove away, I felt confident that Daniel R would not know I was leaving and that I would get away without any problems.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-10-28),-0.14199753,-0.25816593,-0.3384173,-0.08474546
137,"I was in a very large dining facility to give a dream lecture. I was trying to figure out the best place for me to stand to speak so that everyone in the facility would be able to hear me. I saw no place for me to stand so that everyone could see me. This was the shape of the room. I stood on a chair thinking that would help. It was a metal folding chair. I told the crowd that I was trying to find a way that they would all hear me. Everyone was sitting at dining tables eating. Right after I got up on the chair, people started moving around finding different places to sit. All of the people from one of the ells came and sat on the floor in the main area. I said, Good, I didn't feel very safe on this chair in these heels. I looked down, thinking I had on high heels. I had on red shoes with a little heel, but they were not high heels. I mumble something like well they wouldn't have been so bad. There was a fourth part of the room, where the double arrows are, that seemed like it might have been a bar. There were employees of the facility in that area but I don't recall seeing anyone else. Before I started giving my talk, I asked one of the men in the room to take some occasional pictures for me, as I needed them for PR purposes. I showed him how to work my camera. He seemed perfectly okay with doing that. not put out or hassled or anything. I didn't notice him taking any pictures after that. I asked the crowd, What are dreams? A man walked by me and gave me a scientific answer. I laughed and said, You're absolutely right! Still chuckling, I said I've never gotten that answer before, but you are absolutely right! The crowd laughed too. A few other people gave me answers. I was going through explanations of why I was not addressing the scientific explanation of dreams. My explanation included the fact that I am right-brained. though I went through a little mental conversation to get to this phrase. The explanation also included the fact that when I go into scientific explanations I prefer to have my notes in front of me. This likely relates to the scientific aspects of my work and how I feel about talking about scientific and physiological explanations of things there. I then asked, What is the purpose of dreams? I got several answers but none that I was looking for. Therefore, I gave them five purposes of dreams. They included wish fulfillment and playtime. I don't remember now what the other three reasons were that I gave them. I had a heavy stack of 8 x 14 paper in my arms that had things printed on them. notes and pictures for my talk. I was trying to use them as notes but they were too heavy and awkward to hold as I was walking around the room talking so I put them down. I kept the top sheet that I was talking about at that time. It had several pictures on it. Each picture had words on it. The one picture I was currently talking about had something to do with Freud and some of the words were in Spanish and/or French. I read the words, stumbling over them a bit. The man taking pictures for me also read it aloud, much more clearly than I did. I think he said it would be much easier if you knew a foreign language. [Somehow I got this message but I'm not sure how.] I have a sense that the talk went very well. I felt on. I felt the high that I do when I have given a talk that has gone very well and been received very well. The audience seemed to be enjoying themselves. I think this area might be part of a hotel but I'm not sure. Either earlier or in a prior dream last night I was at the hotel. I only remember that I had been at that place or hotel earlier. I don't even know if I left and came back or if I was staying at the hotel for the purpose of giving this talk. I have a sense that it was two separate events and/or times.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-11-09),-0.040627114,-0.17889886,0.18152183,-0.03810016
139,"I was in this very large house. It belonged to very wealthy people. Some young people were having a party here. I don't think their parents knew about it. Perhaps it was an after-prom party, but I'm not sure. Many of the kids were making-out in several of the rooms. Particularly, I found a couple in one of the bedrooms. I was wondering through the house, simply because it was such a large, expensive home and I was interested in seeing all the rooms. I would go up a flight of stairs and the only room would be another bedroom. Another flight of stairs, one bedroom. Etc. I did this several times. On one floor of the building, the bedroom was all white, the furnishings, and everything. It was more like a suite. The front room, I think, was the bathroom and then led into the area where the bed was. In the bed area, the walls seemed to be covered with white billowy curtains. For some reason, I think there were two beds, side by side, instead of one. This doesn't make sense to me because this is the room where the owners of the house would go to make love. Maybe I'm not remembering it right but it just doesn't feel right. I don't know if it was one large bed or two twin beds. Anyway, the bed(s) face an extremely large Jacuzzi. It is the walls around the Jacuzzi that have the white billowy curtains. I thought what a beautiful room this was. But there were no other furnishings or decorations in this room. Just the beds, the Jacuzzi, and the curtains. I think I may have been with someone as I was later checking all the rooms. I don't know if I was checking to make sure everyone was gone or if I was looking for someone. Actually, I think I was looking for someone, but found individual people in more than one bedroom.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-11-11),-0.11143663,-0.02319091,0.1803424,-0.20746036
143,"I was driving in a seemingly unfamiliar town. I decided to drive down C Street as I thought I would find something at the end of that street that I might be interested in. As I neared the end of C Street, I decided that I should probably cross over to D Street. As I was preparing to do that, I passed Cox's. I'm not sure what it was. maybe a factory. I said to myself, Oh yes! I remember them. I think that maybe I worked in the office there for a short time. As I was driving by, I saw a man come out the door with his adult son. The son was mentally handicapped. I said to myself, I remember them, too. He always used to take his son to work and pick him up again. The only difference is that people knew about his disability and they didn't know about mine. I kept driving. As I was driving through the city streets, I realized that I had to merge into the left lane because there was a police car up ahead of me and there was a man dressed in brown lying on the street behind the police car. I was watching the traffic trying to get over and I got very, very close to the police car. I was able to stop before hitting it. The police officer looked up and gave me a dirty look. I backed up and went around. As I went around, however, I noticed that the man was no longer there. I was now walking on the sidewalk instead of driving. I noticed that this town had a section of stores that was more or less New Age. I decided to go into one of them. It was a clothing store. The name was Wicca Fashions or something with the name Wicca in it. As I was in there browsing, I came across some exercise clothing. One of the sales clerks approached me and encouraged me to try it on. From looking at it, I couldn't believe that I would like the way it looked on me. It was two piece, knit, tight fitting, and grey. I went ahead and took one off the rack and started to the dressing room. As I did so, Ruth M came in to see me or to wait for me. To go into the dressing room was a very narrow hallway and one with several twists and turns. I had to back against the wall and squeeze through around each wall. As I got in, I realized that it was also a bathroom and the stalls were very small as well. The sales clerk had come in with me. As I was putting the outfit on she was using the bathroom, she called, by phone, to the front of the store, and told someone we needed more toilet paper. I was totally shocked when I put the outfit on. It was totally sheer, like stockings. I was surprised that as far as my figure was concerned it didn't look bad but I didn't like the sheer aspect at all. I pointed out to the sales clerk how clearly my varicose veins, which I don't have, could be seen. They were quite significant and primarily on one buttock and on an outer thigh. The sales clerk, of course, thought it looked great and tried to say that the sheerness didn't matter. I told her I needed to get back out to my friend that was waiting on me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-11-26),-0.10543745,-0.14762878,0.05731856,0.3525134
146,"I had called Kate D because I thought she should have a list of the phone numbers. I worked with her. Her son answered the phone and said she had them. I asked him to read them to me. There were quite a few. When he read them, there were two digits, the seven-digit phone number, and then two more digits. The first two and last two were always the same and the sequence was in the tens and twenties. When Kate D found out Jonathan D had given me this information she became very upset with him because he gave this information out and he didn't know who he gave it to. She said he should never have done that. Later when I was with Kate D, we were sitting on the floor talking, with our backs leaned up against the wall. I said that it is very hard for me to remember that I am no longer in control there. My eyes started to tear a bit and I wiped them dry. I realized that I needed to tell her it was me that called Jonathan. I didn't want her to think less of me or be mad at me, so I was trying to figure out what to tell her about why I had called and why I had asked for that information. I decided to tell her that truth. that I called because I thought she should have the information and when Jonathan said she did I asked him to read it to me to verify it.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-11-28),-0.15008937,-0.091844894,-0.10531442,-0.120216124
149,"I was walking around this one section of town. The town reminded me of my mother's hometown. I was trying to get some Avon orders to supplement my income since I don't have a regular job right now. I thought that perhaps I should get some books and start working the area for a while until I get another job. As I was walking, I was trying to identify the houses that I know had bought from me before. I walked across these two piles of firewood, stacked side-by-side, belonging to two different families. While I was doing that, some of the wood from a third pile rolled own a small embankment. I didn't go pick it up, convincing myself that it wasn't my fault. I walked by one house and there were many people inside. They might be having a party, so I started to walk on by. They had long rows of small cages with rabbits in them. I saw an opening where I thought I could walk between them but realized there was something overhead and I would have to get on my hands and knees to get through. About that time, the woman that lived there came out and wanted to know why I was there. I told her. She said the only Avon she buys is reorder stuff. I said, Okay. Thanks. Then I left. At this point, there are two other Avon reps walking with me. The woman who owns the woodpile walks up and talks about having to pick it all up. I didn't realize who she was or what she was talking about until she left and the other three of us walked past there again and I saw the little plastic fence messed up. I fixed the fence, put it back in place, but still didn't say it was my fault. On the other side of the fence was a long row of flowers. They looked like they were something special. They were tied up with string that was held up by poles to keep the string 8-12 inches above the ground. I was glad the wood hadn't hurt any of the flowers, but still didn't say anything. We continued walking. We came to a large rack with rows of pullout shelves. It had a few very small potted plants on them. The two women I was with turned some of them on their side so the Avon person responsible for them would know to throw them away. I realized that one of the two people with me was Laura Bl.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-12-03),-0.22695445,-0.102540396,0.33788368,-0.0112783
150,"There were mice in the apartment. They were mostly visible running between the wall and the layer of paint. I watched one run across the ceiling just under the paint, another down the wall, the same way. However when that one came to the floor it ran out and across the floor. Matthew sat something on it and smashed it. I was upset that it was there but also that Matthew had killed it. When he looked, though, it wasn't dead. He went ahead and killed it because it was so injured. I called the apartment office and told them about the problem. I asked if they would call an exterminator. I told them that I had already paid for an exterminator once. I also told them I went through two cans of bug spray trying to get rid of all the ants here. I don't remember if they answered me. I also called someone to get a quote on replacing my carpet and linoleum. I had gotten a quote from this man before, but I didn't tell him that until he got here. Then I tried to make some excuse for not telling him before. We talked about the kitchen first. The floor was divided into three sections. Each section was a different kind of flooring. He brought a woman with him. He said they couldn't do anything to the wood. I said that was fine. I wanted to keep it anyway. They asked about the parquet and I said I wanted it changed. They tore up one corner of the linoleum. They finished the quote. It was about $2300. I knew I couldn't afford that so I was wondering if I could afford part of it and if so which parts to do. I noticed the floor they had torn up in the kitchen. The gold sculpture carpet in the living room and the green carpet in the hallway. I then remembered that the apartment manager would be replacing it in less than a year. I wondered if I should just wait. But I wanted it to look good for the dream groups I will be starting in January. There was also something about me being at the office talking to Laura Bu. There was row/wall of windows that were different shapes and sizes. When I looked a second time, some of the windows were screens. I was talking to Laura Bu through one of the screens. I also remember that going into the house with the man for a carpet quote, we had to go up a set of steps. There were two separate sets. Both were very high and I directed him to enter through the ones that were less high. I couldn't just step into them. I had to climb onto them.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-12-06),-0.30207315,-0.033274528,0.032884236,0.14505048
152,"I was preparing to get married. I don't think I was marrying him for love as part of an undercover plan. He was an extremely wealthy man with a very large estate. He seemed apprehensive about whether the plan would work or not. His estate consisted of a number of buildings. There were quite a number of people who were unhappy about the marriage, including all of my bridesmaids. All of the bridesmaids were not even my friends but acquaintances of his or of the people planning the wedding. The bridesmaids seemed to dislike me/or at least be very upset with me that I was marrying this man. I had gotten dressed for the wedding, traditional wedding gown, and stuck my make-up bag in a pocket of my gown and went to the building where the wedding was to be held. It was not a church. I saw several of the bridesmaids standing around. There were quite a few of them. Maybe even twelve. Their dresses were very simple and elegant, satin and a kind of purple/blue color. They were all very rude to me because they did not like it that I was marrying this man. I rushed into a small room to put my make-up on. Just as I was finishing someone came in to tell me it was time and ask if I was ready. I said I was ready when they were. I left that room and found that several of my bridesmaids were out of place. One was lying down on a bed complaining of cramps another was out of place but I don't remember what her problem was. I told them we would go on without them. As I got to the room where the wedding was being held the bridesmaids had all gone down the aisle already and it was my turn. As I entered the room, I nodded to someone and an usher seated one last couple. I am assuming now that it was the groom's parents. As I was walking down the aisle, I noticed that the room was full of celebrity's. I noticed Michael Jackson wearing a black jacket with circles on it made of gold threads and Elvis Presley. As I got to the end of the aisle there was another couple standing there, waiting to be married. I didn't know before then that it was going to be a double ceremony but I just stepped to the side to stand next to them. As I did someone told me I had to move all the way down to make room for the other couples. A rock band got up right in front of me and started playing. I started to get upset because I didn't like all of these surprises, especially things that I would not have at my wedding, like bridesmaids that were not my friends, other people marrying at the same time, the rock band. My fiance and I left the room without being married. We were standing out side talking. We suddenly kissed very long and hard and realized at that time that we truly did love each other. I felt that I was the male and had initiated the kiss and was a bit taller than the woman was. We are lying under this giant hamburger. It almost seems as though we were lying in a grill but it wasn't hot or anything. We were eating the hamburger, laughing and having a good time. The hamburger had cole slaw covering the top of it. There were a couple of bites out of it. Someone came along and my fiance stood up. When he did, all I could see where his head should have been was the hamburger. I realized that the hamburger was hiding his head and that this was probably a good thing. I realized that the hamburger was hiding his head from the person he was talking to as well.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-12-26),-0.23104511,-0.082676314,-0.2103737,-0.2302016
153,"I was in a department store with Margie D. We were in the linen section. She was looking at slipcovers and commented to me that she was thinking of getting one. I told her that I had recently purchased them for both my sofa and my oversized chair. I also said that while they didn't fit exactly right because of the low arms on my sofa, I am pretty happy with them. I don't remember if I mentioned the color or not. I recall seeing the linens. They were all solid colors, deep colors like navy, forest green, burgundy, etc. While we were looking, I noticed two small girls came up to a screen door and said something to someone in the store. I noticed the man they were speaking with. After they left, I asked him if they were his daughters and he said yes. I commented that they were very cute. As he walked away, I thought he was an attractive man. Then I reminded myself that this was Ernie C I was talking about, and I did not want to get involved with him. The man didn't look like Ernie C until he began to walk away and it wasn't until then that I noted that it was he. Prior to that, I was not familiar with the man. Since Margie D was still looking, I told her I was going to another part of the store and would be back. I put a question mark after store because the environment seems to be confused between being a store and being an office. I'm not sure if it changes or if I just don't know for sure which it is. As I was walking around, I saw Tonya H but didn't get a chance to speak to her. I kept walking and saw my old office at the sleep center. I took a few steps back to look in because I noticed that they had taken a wall out and made one much larger office. When I looked into the office I noticed that they had made this space the office space and had five chairs lined up in a row along a table. This was their workspace. It was very close. They barely had room to move without touching each other. There were three of six people sitting there working. Two of them I did not know. One of them was Lilly H. I asked her how she liked her new space. I said it somewhat sarcastically because I guessed she probably didn't. I tried not to be too sarcastic though because I didn't know the other two people sitting there. She gave me a guarded answer for the same reason but I realized that my suspicion was right. she didn't like the new arrangements. I noticed a baby lying on a blanket on the floor on its back playing. Even though the baby was Caucasian I asked Lilly H if it was Tonya H's new baby. In waking life, Tonya H has only one child and he is perhaps 10-12 years old. I don't remember what Lilly H told me about the baby. I asked if Tonya H was around. She was but not somewhere that I could catch her or speak to her. As I turned around to leave I noticed Steve J. I hurried a bit to make sure I caught him. I said Hi, Steve J! With much enthusiasm. As I did this and got closer, I realized that it was not Steve J. The man asked me if he knew me. I said something trying to make it sound like he did but that I wasn't exactly sure how. I didn't want to admit that I had made a mistake. As I was talking, I leaned and looked at his nametag. It said Steve Galaad [unknown in waking life] . He was a construction worker or something because he had a hammer in his hand that he had raised in the air as we talked. I finally admitted that perhaps we didn't know each other and I must have mistaken him for someone else. I went back to find Margie D to see if she was ready to go. I found her and her two daughters sitting at a large round table eating. I asked what time I had left and they said 7:45 p.m. It was now 8:56 p.m. I said I've been gone an hour? I was surprised and very apologetic. As Margie D would have done in waking life she said it was no big deal and that, fortunately, she had remembered where to get food nearby. at a Chinese restaurant. They were all eating Chinese food. They offered me some but I declined. I apologized again. The table seemed to be in the linen department where the dream began.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-12-27),-0.17785169,-0.021999717,0.011284917,-0.26336366
154,"I was a student at a school and I had done something I shouldn't have. or was at least involved in it with someone else. At least part of it was graffiti. I don't remember what the graffiti was. We ran away but were caught. After being caught, someone else and I had the opportunity to run again. The person who did the graffiti told us to run without him. One part of this that is confusing is that the people I was running with changed several times. I don't know who it was initially. At one point, it was The Golden Girls and later it was girls I went to high school with, and another time it was only Brenda E. At the end, it was my family, Mother, Daddy, Brian F, Bev, and Bill F F. When I was running with Brenda E, I was getting very frustrated with her because she wasn't hiding or keeping up very well. There was a third person running with us. I don't know who. They were way behind. I thought they would catch up with us. We snuck around a red brick school. I was afraid someone would see as through the windows. I told Brenda E to keep down and come around the walls. There were several red brick walls. They were a wavy shape lengthwise. Then we snuck around another red brick building. We finally dodged inside a little dry cleaner/seamstress shop. There were three huge basket-like things hanging from the ceiling and moving back and forth on purpose and rhythmically. We each jumped up and clung to the end of one to keep from being seen by the employees. When we had a chance, we ducked into the next room. We were crouched on the floor behind a circular rack of clothes and fabric. Brenda E wasn't hiding well and I feared we would be seen. One thing in the rack was sheer brown piece of fabric. I could see the old woman through the fabric. I was afraid she would see us. I moved the rod in a circular motion very slightly trying to keep us hidden but she spotted us anyway. I lied and told her that we just needed to duck in from the cold. They took pity on us. Now I'm with my family but still in the same place. The young woman was doing makeovers on us to help keep us from being found. She made Kim H look like a movie star, as she requested. She asked me how I would like my hair done. I told her I like my style so she started spraying it seriously with hair spray. I felt like I was choking on the spray and told her to quit. I was thinking about what movie start I wanted to be made up as but didn't think of anyone so she didn't do anything else to me except to give me a bag of ice and told me to hold it on my face to reduce the puffiness. I held it on my eyes. My family and I are walking downtown Indy. I am watching the people very carefully to make sure none of them are the people who are after us. All I remember seeing is people in business suits carrying briefcases. It is now becoming nighttime and the streets are deserted. We see the horse-drawn carriage nearby sitting by Steak-N-Shake. It is empty but I tell the others that we must stay away from there or we are more likely to get caught. We are in a building looking at displays. They are Christmas displays mostly. One had many stuffed animals. I also saw a bed and pushed on the mattress and said how nice it would be to be in my own bed. Mari Kate S was with us now. We were purchasing things. I remember sweatshirts specifically. We were being careful to use cash so we wouldn't be leaving a trail. Brian F handed me some receipts and told me to make sure I used them. I started filling one out and realized I had written SVSDC, disclosing information on it. I tore it up, showed it to Brian F, threw it away and then paid cash for the sweatshirts. There were people there who were looking for us but they didn't give us away for some reason. The last room we went into had a lot of computers and electronics. I sat down at a desk to check my email. BJ said something about the amount of email. I then saw a Karaoke machine and asked Daddy to come record a song with me. He was a short, dark-haired, Italian man. Brian F joined us. I didn't want him there, but let him stay. We were going to sing We Wish You A Merry Christmas but we didn't know the version that was playing. Then a familiar version began playing so we started to sing. I was thinking that this was good, as I would be able to listen to and better decide if I am a good singer. The guy running the electronic place said he needed to close up. We said we would help because we are very familiar with the things there. We said Mother is very familiar with the type of typewriter so she could take care of it. I saw her sitting on the floor with the case, cleaning it, as part of closing up. I was looking under all the desks for money. Whenever I found change, I put it in my pocket. I found four quarters in a pile and under one desk.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-01-06),-0.1690807,-0.14212306,0.21083929,0.0704736
158,"I was in my bedroom and heard someone come in the front door. The alarm sounded but they silenced it. I knew it wasn't Matthew. I closed and locked my bedroom door. The burglar came to my bedroom door and was quietly trying to get in. He was trying to remove the hinge pins that were on my side of the door. I was pressing my body against the door and holding the lower hinge pin in with my fingers. The pin was missing from the top. He finally gave up and left. I went downstairs, locked the front door, and reset the alarm. The burglar tried to get back in through a dog door at the bottom of the front door. I held the point of iron in the hole to press against/into his head as he tried to enter. I told someone to call 911. The police arrived and arrested him. Two black women, my roommates, showed up. They didn't want him arrested. They had given him the alarm passcode so he could get in. So I told them they should not have done that and they needed to move out that day.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-01-19),-0.21604836,-0.1491213,0.12092183,0.21751122
163,"I was riding this thing I called a bike but it was actually shaped more like a go-cart. It was a metal frame like a bike with just a seat and an awning over head. I was headed to this restaurant, maybe Denny's. As I neared the restaurant, it started to rain slightly. I thought how fortunate I was that I was almost there. When I got to the restaurant, I couldn't find a place to park. I thought it was just as well because I was afraid the bike might be stolen. I folded it up, much as you would fold a luggage carrier and took it inside. When I got inside, I was looking for a place to stand it and a place for me to sit. I struggled a bit, moving it around because it was so big. I finally leaned it against the wall near the coat rack. There were two overcoats hung on peg hooks on the wall so the bike was on top of them. Until this point, I was not thinking about why I was going there or that I was meeting someone else. I entered the restaurant looking for a place to sit alone. After I got in there I saw the women that I was meeting there and went to sit with them. While we were eating, several men came up to us. The other women knew them because they work with them. After a brief conversation, one of the men showed us a video. The video was of a large room with probably hundreds of men in it. I recall one young man in particular. It was his first time in that place and he seemed unsure about himself. The man who took him there was showing him around as if training him for a new job. I have some sense that the men in the video were mobsters. Suddenly, a group of men with machine guns came in and started killing everyone. I watched the video as it scanned the room. Men were falling everywhere as they were gunned down. I kept wondering why no one told this one young man to fall to the ground to try to protect himself. The video had a strong impact on me. I still have a very vivid image of one of the men. He was probably in his 50s, with silver gray hair and medium build. I'm not sure why, but I didn't think much of him that maybe he was somewhat sleazy. Just after the movie, ended one of the women sat down next to me and sat on this man's hand. It was as though she was straddling his arm. She had on a short skirt and white hose. He pulled it out from under here from the front. My first impression was that he did it on purpose and I didn't like that. Then I decided not to assume that. I should consider it an accident. However, after that, he was laying on his back on the floor laughing and she straddled him and was acting, playfully, as if she was going to hit him or something for doing it. Then they both got off the floor. Something started to happen at the restaurant. One of the women I was with also worked there. She came from behind the counter and physically stopped the disturbance. I recall seeing her do a karate kick. I realized now the men and women I met in this restaurant, and myself, were police officers. I had come to this place to take a new job. We all got up to head to the police station. They were laughing about my bike. They said something about the rain and I pointed out that the bike had an awning. They led the way to the town and police station with me following on my bike. As we entered the town, I was simply in awe. It almost looked like something out of a Disney village though not really that either. All of the buildings were very colorful and playful. For example, one was white with red storybook lettering. It is very hard to describe. Every building had many compartments on the outside with a separate item in each compartment things like stuffed animals. I loved it. I was trying to take it all in while following them. They stopped at the police station and I missed it. I got frustrated because I had gone down a hill and now I had to peddle back up the hill. The police station and fire station were attached. You didn't realize the police station was there until you went inside. I got off my bike and a man and a young boy came out to help me with my things. I had several duffel bags attached to my bike that I didn't have before. I took two of them off and handed them to the man. After I had folded the bike up again I gave it and one bag to the young boy. He was in awe of my bike. I kept one bag myself. When I went inside, I was in a very narrow, but short, hallway. Part of the way down the hallway I had to take a step down to continue. At the end of the hallway were several rooms. One was an open room. Several women were sitting around a table. I don't know what they were doing. Behind them was an office door. I went in there to meet the man in charge. He was looking for my first day paperwork and couldn't find it. His wife came in to help. He got on the phone and called someone about it. He was frustrated and telling his wife how it would delay my paychecks if it didn't get done on my first day. She was sympathetic but told him she really needed to get started on the next lunch though I knew she meant the dinner meal, or it would be late. I somehow knew she fixed the meals for the whole crew. I was worried about my pay being delayed.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-02-06),-0.18594691,-0.14475709,0.2346188,0.051905036
164,"I was on a first date. We were at my house, though it wasn't my house in waking life. We were sitting on the sofa talking. I mentioned the movie Stigmata and he said he would like to see it so I put it in for us to watch together. We had kissed 2-3 times. They were very brief, gentle kisses. I thought how nice it was to be with such a gentleman, and someone that I had things in common with. He was laying on the sofa watching the movie and I was sitting behind the back of the sofa taking some bottles of drinks out of their original packages and putting them in a larger box with compartments. Some were beer and some were pink wine coolers. It was the kind of box that wine and liquor bottles come in but there were many more compartments. The bottles were different sizes. Some were very small like those you get on an airplane. One was larger than all the rest. I put more than one bottle in some of the compartments. I don't know why I was doing this. When I was almost done, I realized I was making a lot of noise. About that time, I heard something from my date. I leaned over the back of the sofa and asked what was wrong. He was about to turn the movie off because I was making so much noise with the bottles. I kissed him lightly and told him I was done. Then I lay down on the sofa next to him to watch the rest of the movie. It felt very good being with him.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-02-09),-0.024238158,-0.07787428,-0.117241725,-0.31460598
165,"I was lying in bed, naked, but covered with a blanket and sheet. Marshall E came in. I was surprised but happy to see him. I made sure I was totally covered. He sat down on the floor with his back leaning against the bed. A woman named Kate, someone from TV, came in, sat on the floor, and interacted with him. I could tell there was a romantic connection. I thought Oh no, he's not with her. I think it was part jealousy and part thinking that he could do better. The next thing I know he is standing and telling me how much he has missed me, how he still cares for me, and that he has never found anyone to compare. I was acting very coy and thinking that I was flattered, but unsure if I wanted to encourage him to try again.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-02-13),-0.06782533,-0.062233426,-0.49732378,-0.22917317
167,"I went to a high school to give a talk. There were TV media there. I was on the gym floor sitting on a bench in the middle of the floor. The students were all on one side in the bleachers. They were very poorly behaved. I said something to the media person with a microphone. It was not until this time that I realized they were students. When I arrived at the school, the driveway and parking were very odd. It was as if I was driving down steps and then had to park on one side angled toward the direction I had come in. When I got ready to leave, I was told I had to leave in the direction I was headed when I came in. This was very awkward because of the direction of the parking I also did not know my way going that way. They told me to go the end, take a left, and then right. That I couldn't get lost. When I turned right, I was in something resembling a very narrow alley, one car width wide. I don't recall seeing building but there was a chain link fence and a lot of gates. Every few hundred feet I had to stop and open a gate. It also kept making turns. I was getting frustrated, upset, and angry. I left my car, threw some kind of very large square board to the side, and continued on foot. I came to a bunch of houses and was walking through their yards trying to figure out where the road to the highway was. I finally asked for directions at one house. A man and woman gave me directions but then she suggested that he take me back to my car and then lead me where I needed to go. He did. As we approached my car, he sympathized with me and told me they shouldn't have done that. He especially pointed out that the place I got out of my car was an especially hard place.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-02-15),-0.16795352,-0.1599686,0.24357523,0.22416921
168,"It was my wedding day. I did not see or talk to the groom during the entire day. Most of my family was there. They had me standing on one of the dining tables to take my picture. The tables formed a T and I was standing in the cross section facing the top of the T. At another point, Bruce W was kneeling on the longer table facing the same direction to have his picture taken. Somebody was joking around with him. Later I was looking at the pictures and saw that another of my cousin's, Linda W, was standing on the table behind me when they took my picture. She was a bridesmaid and she was dressed in green. Somebody said she was supposed to be there in that picture. The wedding was at Bev's house. It didn't look like her actual house. Nicholas F came running out with this little green umbrella. It was just big enough around to protect him and it was deep with a very short handle. I thought it was so cute and I played with him and the umbrella for a little bit. I was using the bathroom and Nicholas F was standing to my right. I didn't seem to mind that he was there. I realized that I had no pulled the door shut so I reached up and shut it. At that point, Brian F and Mari Kate S came in. I got upset and said can't a person use the bathroom without being disturbed. Mari Kate S let Brian F climb on her back and she carried him out. I got upset because when he climbed on her back he could see over the stall door. It is now near the end of the reception. I am very tired and want to go home. I put on a pair of white socks and my tennis shoes. Bev and I were sitting next to each other leaned against each other waiting to go. We had fallen asleep like that. John S came to awaken us. I asked if it was time to go and he said yes. This is odd because earlier the wedding was at Bev's house but now we are going home to Bev's house. When we get there, I see John set a brown coffee mug down and I asked him if he had trouble staying awake getting home. He said just a little. We went upstairs and I noticed Rachel S's bed. I didn't want to admit that I had not realized that she had not been at the wedding with us. I said that it's a shame Rachel S couldn't be at the wedding. Where has she been? She had been staying with John's parents. Matthew came up to me. He was only about 9 or 10 years old. I hugged him and rested my chin on his head. I asked him if he had a good time. He said not really, because he didn't even get to show me the menu he made for me. I didn't pay much attention to him. I felt really bad.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-02-17),-0.22511959,-0.12932625,0.0063382955,-0.09290246
171,"I was in a crowded store, like a Target or Wal-Mart, in a checkout line. I was a police officer. There were other police officers there as well. Suzanne B was there also, as a police officer. We were all in checkout lines. There was a criminal of some sort loose in the store. I was the first to spot him coming towards us from the right rear. I yelled, there he is and pointed to him. I was talking mostly to Suzanne B because I thought she had a clear shot of him. He was wearing a tan suit, white shirt and a tie. He was a tall man with brown, balding hair and mustache. After I shouted to Suzanne B, everyone dropped to the floor and I tried to crawl under the register counter. I had just gotten under it when the gunman appeared on the floor right next to me. He handed me his gun and told me to keep it on the crowd. As soon as I had the chance, I began taking shots at the criminal. I took a couple of shots and didn't kill him. I then got very scared. As soon as he turned his back, I shot him a couple more times until I was sure he was dead. It felt awful. I was really shaken up by it. Suzanne B and I were at the police department I think yet it also seemed that we were still somehow at the store. We were at our lockers getting changed and talking about what happened. As we were walking out, I was trying to apply lipstick and tried three times before I actually got it to stay on. We ran into the police chief. He wanted to talk to me primarily about the shooting, at least partially to make sure I was okay. I was dressed in a nice dress and high heels and had fixed my hair. He said something about whenever I walk into a room I get men's attention. He said he observes and always sees at least ten heads turn. I'm not sure what this has to do with anything.

172,"I was at a hotel for a conference. I met Wes S there. He invited me to come to his room with him and another woman. I was hesitant but, as in the past, had a hard time telling him no. When I got to the room another woman came in also and another man. I noticed a large round pendant around Wes S's neck. It was clear with something red inside of it. I left because I was uncomfortable with the sexual atmosphere in the room. After I left, the room transformed into two large meeting rooms. Many of the employees of the hotel were going in and joining in the activities. The activities remind me of the movie Eyes Wide Shut. As I was walking through the hotel, I overheard members of management getting upset because so many employees were missing. They were going to fire all of them. I decided to just leave. I went to the parking garage to find my car. All of the cars but mine were very expensive cars and limos. Mine looked like an oversized chair. I folded it down and it became a car. As I getting ready to get into my car, I saw Wes S's pendant lying on the ground. I knew it was important to him so I decided to go find him and return it to him. I was walking outside on a second or third floor with an atrium in the middle. I thought I heard Wes S down below. I looked over the rail and he was there. I told him I had his pendant. When I met him to give his pendant back, he apologized profusely for what happened in the room.

173,"I was staying at a hotel with people I knew. We were there for some kind of professional conference. I went into an area that looked like a big warehouse. Vendors were sitting around with boxes of their things to set up in booths. One of the vendors was CFC. I was sitting at a table with Lilly H. She told one of the reps that they know if they want our business that they have to bring two of any gifts to her and her co-worker. I said no, they have to bring three, meaning they have to bring one for me also. I went down some steps to go outside. There was a busy street, several lanes wide. I crossed the street to go somewhere. I realized I only had socks on but decided to go ahead. When I came out to go back to the hotel it was raining really hard. I took my socks off and ran barefoot across the street. After I crossed the street, I noticed a place that I could walk under and not get wet as long as I stayed right in the middle. The further I went though the lower the top got. I finally got to a place where I either, had to get on my hands and knees and crawl through this drainage pipe or I had to squeeze through this other opening to my left side. This part is especially odd because the opening couldn't have been more than 12-inch square. I was somewhat concerned that I would get stuck going through there. I thought about my option of the drainage pipe and decided to take my chances with the other opening. It was tight and I got a little nervous after I was halfway through but I got through. The best way I can describe how I got through is what you might see if a cartoonist drew it. When I got back to the hotel, I was having a conversation with my boyfriend. We went and sat down by another woman that he was also dating. I got really upset with her, got in her face, pointed my finger, and told her this conversation does not concern her. I really thought some ugly things about her. I said that I needed to get out of here. I got up and walked away. I knew if I didn't I would say something mean to her and I didn't want to do that. I went outside. The rain had stopped. My boyfriend came after me. He wanted to fix things. I told him I wasn't going to do this anymore. I did not want to hurt his other girlfriend so I was not going to see him anymore. I told him I would fly home the next morning, as I couldn't afford my own hotel room. He did not want to lose me. He begged me to stay and said he would end it with her. I said that wasn't fair to her. I really didn't want to hurt her. I also wanted to respect myself so I would leave. I told him how very much I loved him and how incredibly difficult this would be for me but that in the long run I knew it would be better for all three of us. He said if he was going to lose one of us it would not be me. I finally agreed to stay and let him break it off with her. He got another hotel room. He told me to get just a few things out of our joint room for now. All three of us were in the same room. He said he would get the rest of our things out and bring them to our new room after he had talked with her. I expected it to take awhile but it didn't. He came to the room and said it was time to celebrate. Just at that moment, there was a knock on the door. It was room service with champagne, strawberries and whipped cream, candles, and bubble bath. He said we would take a bubble bath, make love, and then have a wonderful dinner brought to the room. Somehow, I knew that during dinner he was going to ask me to marry him.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-02-26),-0.22359839,-0.09434894,0.2534406,-0.078787595
174,"I was with Nick R. We were living together and sharing a bed but I don't know if we were married or not. I told him I would now need to know what his name really is. He said it is R Williams. We were living in a house in the country. It was very small with maybe 4-5 rooms but I only remember two of the rooms. There were curtains in the doorway between the two rooms. The one small room was divided by a partial wall. I used it for storage. I had to bend over to go through the doorway into that space. There was a window in that space. Before moving into the house, we talked about the fact that we would need to add plumbing. We were talking about the kitchen. There were several people. Kim H, Jody S, Matthew, some other young man, and a young woman who was kind of our housekeeper. Three groups of really rough looking men came into the house without knocking on several occasions. After the last group did this, Nick R left the house with a shovel and something else and I was afraid of what he might be planning to do. He was very angry. He killed and buried several of the men after swearing to me he was done with the Mafia and their ways. He came back dressed kind of like an Indian. He said he put them all in the ground. I was so disappointed in him. Something else happened and we were saying that we needed to go after someone. No one else would so I got on a horse bareback, even though I didn't know how to ride. I had a lot of trouble getting on the horse. I finally did and then chased after that person or those people. We rode to church for Ash Wednesday morning Mass in a wood carriage, like you would see in an old western movie, pulled by a horse. Myself, Matthew, Kim H, and Jody S all went.

176,"I was in my apartment with my two sons. It wasn't the same apartment that I actually live in and I only have one son. We were sitting at a counter, on stools, and getting ready to eat some ice cream. Someone had given us a gift of gourmet ice creams. They were special shapes and flavors. My younger son, not Matthew, was using a spoon and digging into the middle of lots of them to try each one without choosing one and finishing it. I scolded him and told him not to do that. Three of the ice creams were flat and round, like tostados. One was pink. One was blue. There was third as well. They had sprinkles or something like that on them also. Some of them were bars that stood on their side and had two sticks in them. There was a man and a woman to the right behind Matthew. I don't remember what they were doing there. As we finished the ice cream, I started cleaning up and there was a large, African American woman sitting on a table to my left. She had her back to me and was on the phone. She was wearing cultural clothing. I realized that she was about to sit in some ice cream so I nudged her to sit up a bit so I could wipe it up before she sat in it. I was thinking about moving my computer downstairs.

178,"I was with my CRHP sisters. Some details are very, very sketchy. I stepped into this area where I was going to be wrapped up like a postal package. We could decide what kind of wrapping we wanted. I decided plain brown wrapper with white string. When I stepped into the spot, Tom Hanks appeared and did the wrapping. He was having a lot of fun doing it. I was so excited. He was really, really nice to me. It was as if it was some kind of game. Later I was with just a few friends and there was one or two children. I thought it was odd that we were dressed in swimsuits and robes but they said that was the typical dress for where we were going, to just put a robe over your swimsuit. Then I saw we were going to a swimming pool. At the pool, there was a large group of men sitting all around in their street clothes. I realized this was another joke. They had arranged for all these men to be there. They said they wanted to see me in a swimsuit. I let my robe fall open a bit and pretended not to notice as I continued to talk to my friends. I finally took my robe off, got into the pool, and swam the width of the pool. After I got to the other side, I got out and saw all the men were gone. They said they were only there to see me in a swimsuit so as soon as they did they all got up and left. One of my women friends was surprised that I didn't look half-bad in a swimsuit. I felt pretty confident but also recognized the areas where it was obvious that I need to lose weight. I went to get back in the pool and there was this thing, reminds me of a mattress cover, covering the entire area of the pool. I lay down on top of it. It was very relaxing. I was back in my room. I'm confused as to whether it was a hotel. I think not. I was with my CRHP sisters again. We were putting some things away. There were Christmas decorations and Halloween costumes. I was dividing them into piles because they each needed to go to different rooms. I took the Christmas stuff to two different places. Then I took the Halloween stuff to another place. BJ was on a ladder and I handed her the costumes on hangers. She wasn't sure what to do with them and then turned around and saw others hanging above and behind her. She asked if I was sure that this is where they were supposed to go. I said yes. I was thinking that this is where they are kept for storage until it is time to get them out. I was at NTNS. Someone else and I are carrying these things into an attic, kind of like the one in my birth home. I think Bob F was one of the ones helping. I was separating things into piles by the boxes they would go in. Several of us were in the attic and I pointed out that we needed to start digging out the boxes. Nobody really wanted to because it was going to be a big hassle. I can still picture it in my mind but I don't know how to describe it. I leave and am back at my home/apartment/hotel. We are supposed to be getting ready to go to a play. I realize that I am the last one to get ready and the others are trying to be patient in waiting for me. I am rushing around trying to get ready as quickly as possible. I end up having to change a thing or two. Suzanne B is worried that we are going to be late but I can see she is trying very hard to be patient. I put on my black satin suit and decided to wear flats instead of heels since we were in a hurry. They were quicker to grab and I could walk faster. When we were headed out, we went through this area that looked like a building under construction again. Tom Hanks was there again and pretended that he was going to wrap me up again. This time he said he was just playing around and was just there to walk me to the car and say good-bye. I asked if I could give him a hug and kiss. I intended to just kiss him on the cheek. He leaned over and gave me a very light, quick kiss on the lips and a big hug. I felt like I had died and gone to heaven. I was so excited. He walked me to the car. When we got to the play, I was suddenly with Mother and Daddy. I told Daddy to go and ahead and Mother and I would catch up. It seemed like we were someplace like Las Vegas. Once inside I was back with my CRHP sisters. We were standing around talking. I was telling them about Tom Hanks. Several of them told me that Sheila G had arranged all of that for me specifically. I walked through the crowd of them to Sheila G. Sheila G appeared to me as Tracy P, but I knew it was Sheila G. I thought, oh yeah, she has a job where she has contact with or access to these stars. I thanked her profusely for what she had arranged with Tom. I was very excited. There was another part, but I'm not sure where it fits in here. Someone had arranged for a seal, an actual animal, to come to my room as a date. I was very upset and was trying to hold the door so it couldn't get in. It was trying to squeeze in under the door. I was trying to hold the bottom of the door with one hand while grabbing things to block the door and the seal with another. I grabbed a few items and was finally able to block the door and get enough weight against it so the seal couldn't get in. The seal left but then came back later and tried again. I did the same thing but this time I eventually got enough things in front of the door that I could move away long enough to move furniture in front of the door as well. I needed that to keep the seal out that time, as he seemed more determined than ever to get. The furniture successfully kept him out.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-03-04),-0.13246325,-0.15646215,0.0038565553,-0.1775039
179,"I was living in an apartment in the city. I was setting up my computer in a chair. I was trying to kind of stack it so it would stay in place against the back of the chair and I was going to use it that way. I was trying to figure out a way to set it so I could easily access the A drive. I was also changing my clothes at the same time. I went out to go to a nearby store to get something related to the computer but I don't remember what. It was raining. I think the place that I went into was kind of like a mall but it was fairly narrow and it was as if I was walking through one store and then another to get to each store. When I got to the store, I was looking for I went to the counter and was discussing my needs with a young man there. An older man came out. I realized it was Mike M. I didn't acknowledge that it was him, nor did he acknowledge that it was I. He came up to the counter and joined in the discussion. I realized that my clothes were lying around and I quickly grabbed them up, embarrassed for him to see that, especially since my bra was lying there to. I embarrassingly said, Sorry, I was changing my clothes while I was working. I'm sure he knew it was me because he has seen a picture of me. I haven't seen a picture of him so I don't know how I knew it was him. We finished our discussion and I rushed out of the store, back through the other stores, and out into the rain.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-03-05),-0.18002503,-0.14770174,0.11629182,-0.07296515
184,"I was at WDF. There was a section of the plant that was like a doctor's office or hospital. The nurses were taking my blood pressure but they didn't know which number was systolic and which was diastolic. I tried to tell them that the 118 was the upper number as that was pretty normal for me. They didn't believe me. They took it twice. They were worried that it was much too high so they were going to have someone else take it again. This person pumped the sleeve up and then walked away to do something else without reading it. She thought she would be back in time to read it. She did this twice. She apologized for getting distracted and told me to take a break and come back. I went to find a bathroom. They told me where I had to go out into the plant. I did. There were two Port-o-Lets out there. One for men and one for women. There were men working around there and I was afraid that the ones working up high would be able to see down in through the top. I realized that the top was covered with something dome shaped. I went in. One of the sidewalls had an opening down to my waist. I decided they couldn't see too much from that angle so I was going to go ahead and use it. Then I realized that there was no toilet in it so I went back out. I got some lunch but I don't remember how, where or what. I was sitting on the floor with some other people watching an interview. I realized that it was Kendall B that they were interviewing. I was so excited. I was eager to hear his voice again and to hear what he had to say. As I was sitting there, Vince P came up behind Kendall B and motioned to me. I was also excited to see him so I went out to talk to him. He said he decided to come there because I had tried to get in touch with him. I asked how he, Sue P and his family were. I actually asked twice but he didn't answer me. He looked great, as always, but was wearing his hair in a different style. We were suddenly outside in a neighborhood. 2-3 other cars were driving crazy and almost hit his car. We were walking and I was looking through the trees for his car. I wanted to see what he was driving. I don't think I ever saw it. He started telling me about this girl he had seen a few times but decided not to see her again. I was reading his description of his experience with her. He was describing their experience making love, though his description was cryptic rather than using the exact terms. He decided not to see her again because she enjoyed sex too much. This seemed odd to me since I was often put off by his sexual interests. In this thing I was reading, she said she would try to be more quiet. I don't know how to explain the paper I was reading. I was using my hands to pull it out a little at a time as I read it. Kind of like I was unrolling and rolling it as I read. The letters were very large and various bold colors. There were also flowers on it. I went back inside for them to take my blood pressure again. There was a head nurse who had just started working there. She had been taking inventory of supplies, cleaning up, and organizing. I looked out a window and saw her mowing the grass and some really tall weeds and such. My first thought was how much I enjoy mowing grass. Then I noticed that she had a really heavy-duty mower. It was mowing down tree trunks that were approximately 1 inch in diameter. I wished I had a mower like that. Then I thought it was sad that she was cutting down the tall stuff and destroying the natural environment like that. I climbed up and sat on a cabinet. It had a warped wood surface. I wondered if it would hold me or what they would say, so I only sat on it partially. I decided to ring the nurse call button. I was surprised at how loud it was. Someone came and looked at the call screen to see who rang them, then looked at me. It was Rosemary P. I told her what had been going on and that I was still waiting. I saw Gale W in the background. Rosemary P told me I wasn't supposed to skip a meal and I told her that I had just eaten.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-03-12),-0.23189898,-0.16590227,0.16778052,-0.066449985
185,"Matthew and I were at a Value City store. He was returning something and I was going to have my class ring sized. There was a long line moving very slowly. Some people cut us off. Mother was in the line standing next to me. She said, There's two lines. I said, no, there is only one line and that woman cut us off, and pointed to her. Mother let us get back in line ahead of her. The next thing I knew, Ola S was in line in front of me. She was very short. less than 4 feet. She was carrying on like she always does. When it was her turn she couldn't see over the counter. I took the paper that the clerk was trying to hand to her and gave it to her. When it was my turn, I asked how long it would take. She said she could resize the ring as soon as she took care of all the people in line. I was very reluctant to let her keep the ring. I told her that the ring is very valuable. The line was so long that I didn't think she would get to it before the store closed so I decided not to leave it with her. I thought I should probably take it to a jewelry store anyway. After I got out of line I decided to go look at rugs. They didn't have the right color for the upstairs bathroom. All they had was a rose color. I thought about how that would look. I decided that I needed one for the downstairs bathroom more. They had the right color but I was afraid it was too big.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-03-12),-0.34817266,-0.065423794,0.1858995,-0.053437036
189,"I was with a female roommate. It was Jacqueline Smith, the actress. Maybe I wasn't with her. She went into the apartment and this man was there. She had a condom and he had one too. One was lying on a bedside table. He said see, we're supposed to have sex, and we're supposed to do it twice. Something else happened and he said something to confirm that too. She did. After they both had their clothes off, he got under the blanket and then came out with a small axe and started slitting her throat. I was there at that point, because I ran out and I tried slamming doors shut behind me and locking them. I ran out into a neighbor's house and knocked on their front door and hid behind a bush so he wouldn't see me if he came after me. I think he did. I think he took me back to the apartment. When I got into the apartment I went into a room and pushed the door shut and tried pushing a bookshelf in front of it. That wasn't strong enough to keep him out. I realized I would have to push more bookshelves against it to keep him out.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-03-15),-0.23935212,-0.2444158,-0.030848457,0.06376501
190,"I was an officer in some kind of military unit. I had my unit out. All of them were standing together in one room. There were a lot of them. I was in another room. I went into my room and there were three light switches but none of them would work. There was just a hole there. It was pitch black dark in the room. So I went back to where my unit was and I had one of them come with me. Actually, several of them came with me. They went in and found a couple of lights and turned them on and got the lights working so I could turn them on from the switches. The one farthest from me was missing so they rigged it so it would always be on. It was a small light that would be on all the time. The other room was kind of like three sections and one section was all the men. The next section was two women; one might have been an officer whose rank was between mine and the rest of the unit. The last section was two more women in separate beds. When we got the lights working in my room I came back into their room and I grabbed two pillows from that last bed and took them into my room. The men that I took with me had been drinking. I decided to go for a drive and get something to eat. When I did I saw one of the members of my unit out there. I sat and watched and saw his pregnant wife there too. He was beating her and she lashed back, apparently had just taken self-defense lessons so he wouldn't be able to do this to her anymore. She fought back and trapped him on the ground between two trash dumpsters and then walked away and I did too. I just left him there and called the police and told them that there had been. I don't know. I told them they could find this man there. I was looking for a fast food restaurant. I pulled into one and realized it was a drive-in restaurant, like Dogs N' Suds, so I backed out and left. I was having trouble seeing because I was driving from the back seat, right side and something on the seat in front of me kept moving around blocking my vision. I was afraid I was going to have a wreck. I passed a Burger King but it was closed and dark.

194,"The SVSDC was being expanded. They had remodeled all of the storage cabinets in the sleep area. They looked like kitchen cabinets. All of the doors were etched glass with white knobs. The cabinets were white. It was cool the way they were expanding the building. They had a forklift and they just lifted one of the walls and moved it out further. When I was walking around, there were quite a few patients standing around and two of them were in bed. One was Brandy C. I asked someone if she was having another sleep study. I was standing at this sink cleaning out something that was shaped like a lint roller but it was metal and had holes and things sticking out of it. It had some really goopy stuff in it and I was standing there gagging as I was cleaning it. Anne Marie [unknown in waking life] was standing on the other side of the sink facing me and told me that it's just mucus. There was also this other woman standing to my right. It was a woman from ER. The one that sponsors Carter but I can't remember her name. She was more sympathetic. I wouldn't even say what it was that I was cleaning out. Then I had this piece of meat, maybe a steak, while I was standing there at the sink. I wanted to lay it down and wanted someone to grab a plate for me. Instead this other woman laid a huge piece of raw salmon on the counter and I laid the steak on top of it. I had put a bunch of Rolodex cards into a Rolodex and it was overflowing. They didn't want to buy another one so I went to the sleep area to see if I could find another one in storage. While I was back there, I started talking to Susan J. We were both complaining about things they had done back there. They didn't want us to spend money on office supplies but yet they had all the cabinet doors replaced with this expensive engraved glass. I also noted that all of the cabinets had kitchenware like glasses and plates instead of the normal sleep center supplies. I had an idea about what I could do for the Rolodex. I saw this three-sectioned container on the desk that could be readjusted and made into a Rolodex so I went back to the office to try that. I was talking to one of the construction workers about the expansion. I said, pretty soon, we're going to be all the way out to the road. He said that the plan was to eventually take over the whole lot. I said, 'yes, I realize that.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-03-18),-0.052788895,-0.024536744,0.2267687,-0.10344698
195,"I was at my birth home with Bev, Bill F, and Brian F. The house had been sold and the people who had bought it came to work in the yard. I heard a lot of noise outside so I went to look out the window. I tried to do it so they wouldn't see me. I saw them using the rotary tiller in the flowerbeds by the backside of the porch. I knew daddy had told them they could use the lawn mower but I didn't know if this was okay. I wanted to call and let them know. None of us could remember the new phone number. We called BJ because we knew she would know it. When I got her on the phone, she gave me the number. One of the others handed me two pieces of paper but they were full of writing and I wasn't sure where to write the number down so I gave the pen to Bill F and told him to write it down. I talked to BJ about something else too. Mother and daddy showed up before I could call them. They were fine with what the new owners were doing. We went out to the garage. There were a lot of people sitting out there. Daddy pulled some grape branches down from the ceiling of the garage for Brian F to help him pick. I was so excited because I love grapes. There were green and purple ones both. I reached up and daddy pulled some branches down for me some to pick also but the ones he gave me just had single grapes on them instead of bunches so I had to pick them one at a time. After I finished I accidentally grabbed someone's foot. I looked at daddy and said I guess I can't pick the big toe can I? Or the others either? I felt embarrassed that I thought for a second that I could pick them. Daddy was sitting with some other men now and he told me there were more grapes up in the rafters but I would just have to climb up there to get them. I stepped on the bench between him and some other man to get myself up to the rafters. When I got up there, I turned around, looked down, and saw Aunt H and Aunt P were there with Aunt R. Aunt R looked really healthy, like she did years ago. She was standing and talking. At first, I didn't see any grapes in the rafters. Then I noticed some on the other side but didn't know how to get over there. There was a small beam that I could scoot across to get over there but it seemed scary to me, even though I knew I had done it before. The beam had stuffed store all along it and I didn't know if there was room for me. I also realized I could get down and climb back up the other side but that seemed like a pain. I did end up on the other side but I don't know how. When I got over there I saw bunches of grapes in bags like the kind you find in at a grocery store. These were all green. I thought this is great. I can freeze a bunch of these. Then I realized that some of them were already frozen. I then noticed that there were also packages of frozen meat up there. I didn't think about it then but I don't know how this stuff could have been frozen because it was just a storage space for all kinds of stuff/junk. The next scene I was talking to this black woman who couldn't walk on her own but I'm not sure how or why. She had pulled herself up by this cart, kind of like a hot dog vendor cart. She was going to try to walk around using that as a support. This man came in and she said something to him about being able to get around now and wanting to go on a date. We agreed to baby-sit the kids but I have no idea whose kids we were talking about except that it wasn't theirs. He finally agreed. Then I'm back up in the rafters and I see two stuffed dummies. The kind you might find sitting on a porch at Halloween where someone had stuffed clothes to make it look like a person. They were hanging from the rafters. They looked just like the two people that were going out on a date. The female dummy had her back to the male dummy and he had his arms around the female dummy as though he was supporting her. I saw other dummies hanging up there as well.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-03-18),-0.31773633,-0.12015097,0.12029637,0.072454445

Angie Ho, Darren, and Annie H were there. I didn't have any clothes on and neither did Angie Ho. They all just stayed in the room, sat down, and started talking. I finally went in my closet and closed the door thinking they would get the hint and leave, but they didn't. I finally stuck my head out and said I really don't mean to be rude, but can I have some privacy? Angie Ho gave me this dirty look. I closed the door back up and they finally left. I got dressed and went out. Myself, Terri O, other CIIS group members were cleaning. We were getting ready for some execs. One of the men in charge came up to us and told us not to forget to clean this part of the banister at the bottom of the steps so I grabbed a rag and went down and cleaned it right away so we wouldn't forget. A few minutes later we were doing something else and he came by and looked at it then looked at it and then looked at us and smiled that we had remembered. It was really dusty and dirty. We went back upstairs and there was this little dog up there. It was a longhaired small dog. I asked what breed it was. The fur was really soft but it looked kind of like a beagle. Terri O said, no, it was a boxer. I was really surprised. When I looked at the face again I could kind of see the resemblance. There was this little puppy there too. The puppy was playing with the boxer. I thought, oh that boxer is so sweet I think I would like to have one like that. It kind of snipped at the puppy's mouth. I told it not to do that. Well, so much for that! I thought I wanted that dog! I know I don't now. The same man came back and was pointing out this painting, and said that the name was wrong on it. He said it was his son and that we needed to correct the signature on it. We did. He came by later and said tell them the story to point out that it was still wrong. I said, I'm sorry, I don't understand. Someone said the initials are supposed to be A.C. not S.A. Then after the man walked away I asked, why didn't he say that instead of telling us this whole story? Why didn't he just say, It's supposed to be A.C.? Then I walked into this conference room with this one man. I'm not sure who it was. I feel that I knew him but I can't identify him. We went in and sat down at a table to listen to a speaker. We were at a table with Carmen A and two of her friends. Her hair was really big and I touched it. It was hard with hair spray. She turned around and said, It looks really nice, doesn't it? I said, yes, it does. I didn't really think so. Then I went to another table to get a coffee cup. I came back, poured myself some coffee, and put an extraordinary amount of sweetener in it. I was looking for cream. I realized that I had to go to the back of the room to another table to get some cream. I didn't really want to but I realized that it was coffee with caffeine and I knew the effect it would have on me and I thought the creamer but lessen the effect somewhat. They didn't have any decaf so I went ahead and drank it because I really wanted coffee.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-03-19),-0.31632876,-0.10509117,0.10057454,-0.18916818

She ran into this bedroom a couple of times to this old woman to say goodnight. Where we were sleeping was surrounded by bookshelves. Some of the bookshelves formed like a square with just a little entryway. I was sleeping inside there and she was sleeping on the other side of one of the bookshelves. I gave her my blue sleeping bag and told her she could use it either as a sleeping bag or a comforter. She had hoped she would get to sleep on a bed and I told her no. I told her to go into the other bedroom and get a pillow off the bed to use. She brought those out and then she went into the older woman's bedroom again to say goodnight one more time.

I asked her if she wanted a baby. She was so happy. She kept asking me if I was sure. Are you sure this is okay? She didn't want to take it if it was someone else's baby. I said, no, someone else deserted it, so you may have it. Then the baby started crying and I went to get it some milk.

It was almost as though it was partitioned off rather than having walls. It was very contemporary. Everything had very contemporary curvy lines to them. I really don't know how to explain this at all. Anyway, he chased all the people out. I whispered something to him. I realized there were more people in there still.

I was afraid to try them because I didn't want the cigarettes, only the matches. I leaned my hand against one of the machines to balance myself while I stepped over this guardrail so I could go into the store. When I did that, I found a dollar and some change, two quarters, a penny, and others. I went in the store and got in line. Just before it was my turn at the register, I saw another man come in and pick up a book of matches. He showed it to the clerk and walked out. I went ahead and grabbed a book but then it was my turn. I laid it on the counter and paid 26 cents for it. The clerk didn't get me any change. I walked out of the store and then realized I walked out with the matches. I decided that maybe I should buy a pack of cigarettes. I got out of line and then I had to get back at the end of the line because I thought I would have to get them from the cashier.

The only person I recognize is the woman who plays CJ on West Wing. Some of the people were dressed to sneak in and kill a lot of the people in attendance. They were particularly interested in killing anyone associated with this one vicar of the Catholic Church. They specifically killed one priest that was in their way. He was killed by the _____ the priest _____ an acquaintance so it took the priest completely by surprise. There was as green tablecloth with two spots on it. One of the killers poured some wine on both spots. Then someone said, that means that you're going to kill me too. The killer said, yes, you are wise. There was a chase with that person who was to be killed as they tried to get away, but they didn't. When the killers first entered, this one woman that I recognized, her date was one of the killer but she didn't realize it until he made the signal. Then all of the killers that were with him started attacking. She was trained in self-defense because she successfully killed or surprised several of the killers and remained safe. There were two girls, late teenagers, sisters, that were running away. They were with the killers and had been asked to kill these two little girls. That was over the line for them so they were trying to run away. Their mother was not one of the killers. She kept calling to them, Come back, Come back and we'll forgive you. The one girl gave up trying to run away and stayed with the killers. The other one came back to be with her Mom and her family. Where the one woman and the one killer were getting dressed to go to the event there was something about jewelry. It was as though I had displayed this jewelry but I don't know how to explain this. The images are really disturbing to me but I can't readily describe them.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-04-09),-0.057522003,-0.04985454,0.056028992,0.081058644
209,"I was in the yard of a house we were living in. I had bought a huge piece of something like Astroturf. I took it out of the plastic wrapper and unfolded it. I laid it out and on top of some trees and bushes. I wondered about cutting holes in it to get it around the trees. It didn't cover the whole front yard. The very front had a small embankment. I went and looked at the backyard to see about putting it there. I decided it would fit well there either. A friend of Matthew's said they were looking at that for their yard. I said I wasn't sure I like it anymore. I told him I was going to need three of them for the front yard alone. Darren said he wanted some time alone so he was going out for breakfast and a hike. He had a backpack on. As he walked away, I was thinking that he doesn't know how far it is to the restaurant. There were lots of Matthew's friends around. I was in the bathroom and some of them opened the door, came in, washed their hands, and then left again. They didn't knock and didn't say a word about me being in there. I realized that I should lock the door.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-04-16),-0.2805878,-0.16999419,0.07214452,0.08339243
213,"I went to the YMCA with a bunch of women from church. I don't think they were my CRHP sisters. In fact, I didn't know anyone. One person was there as our trainer to get us started on a program. Some of the women were having more difficulty than I was. I was trying to be encouraging and supportive to them. I told one in particular that I wasn't trying to be pushy, that I was only trying to be her cheerleader. She and one or two of the others were wearing dresses to work out. They were kind of out-of-style. Straight, cotton, pastels with collars, belted waist and button down the front. As one of them was working out, I saw the trainer behind her kind of spotting the weights. Although there was no need to because it was a weight machine. One of the weights did kind of stick or something at first as they sometimes do. I was waiting my turn sitting on another machine. While I was waiting, I could see into another part of the gym. Through glass windows, I noticed my name on one of the machines. At first, I thought it said, or meant, that I passed on it the last time, meaning I didn't use it. I then realized that it said something was completed. I realized that it had been a long time since I had been there so I figured not many people use that machine if my name was still on it. When we were done, I went to get my puppy out of this one room before going home. Someone there had been watching him for me. He was actually there for another reason but had agreed to watch him for me while I worked out. There were puppies running around all over the place. There was a woman sitting on the ground with her kids. I think they were having a picnic. Their puppy was running around also. The name of their puppy was Monica. They said they chose that name because it's an unusual name for a puppy. I said I had named my puppy that for the same reason but it was also the name of its mother. I was kneeling on the floor and these puppies were running all around me. There were two bulldogs that were really bothering me. I thought they were going to bite me. One was brown with green spots. I kept pushing them away and I wanted to get up but it was as though I was paralyzed there. I did finally get up but I don't know how. I still couldn't seem to get away from the puppies. I was talking to Matthew about paying him $5 and how to get it to him .I told him I would mail it to him but he said his wife could come pick it up. I asked him how much longer he would be there and he said at least another hour. My puppy was playing behind the closed door so I told Matthew I would leave the puppy with him while I went to my locker to get my things and then I could pay him. When I went to the locker room, I accidentally went into the men's locker room. I saw the men in the hot tub and realized what I had done. I left and again, mistakenly, went into the other men's locker room. When I finally went into the women's, there were three different sections. I realized that I didn't remember which locker I had used or the number on it. I started trying my key in all the locks. I was afraid someone would see me. My key opened some of the locks but they weren't mine. Sometimes I had trouble getting the things back inside to close it. Many of the lockers were very small, maybe 18 inches by 6 inches. Some of them I left unlocked because I could get the things back in. There were some very unusual locks too that I had to do certain things in order to relock them. I was getting very upset that I didn't remember and that I couldn't find it. I was worried what people would think. I also worried that may be I had mistakenly used one of the men's lockers. One aisle of the women's lockers was very narrow. I started checking these but then realized I would not have used them because of the narrow aisle. I finally gave up, went, and told Matthew what happened. I was very upset because I said my keys were in there too. I then realized I had the car key hidden on the car. Then I could get home and the apartment office could let me in the house. I also then realized that I usually have my purse under the front seat of the car when I go into the YMCA so maybe I had done that this time.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-04-21),-0.16325763,-0.04744079,0.19532752,-0.19084509
214,"I got in a small canoe and rode down a canal in a city. This time, just before I got to the waterfall-like place I stopped myself. I went to the canal three times. The second time I got in the canoe. The first time I saw a canoe with a cake in it that was shaped like a large cruise ship but it was the size of a normal cake. The second time I saw the owner of the cake and spoke with her. She began to destroy the cake so I began taking parts and eating. The second time I was passing boats of other people. The last two I passed the people were all asleep. Just as I stepped myself, I realized I should have wakened them to warn them they were approaching the fall. They woke up and started screaming. I had gone under several overpasses before I reached this point. The third time I was sitting in snow along the canal. I called BJ on the phone.

This man and I were the only people in the room. I thought this was going to be a good room for me to use to teach. The man closed a window and I thought, that it will be nice that I can open the windows for the students for whatever reason. I was outside the building now with several people. Three of them were the final two survivors and the man who comes on for challenges and tribal meetings. One of the final survivors was Andy Williams. The other one was Colby. Someone said something about what if something happened to the host. Then one of the final two would have to fill that role as well. We were talking to Andy because Colby was asleep. We were simultaneously on the island and in the parking lot at the same time. Andy decided he would win by cutting Colby's hand off while he was sleeping. I didn't think he was serious until I saw him put this huge knife to Colby's wrist. I started screaming and saying, oh my God. He did it. Oh my God. He did it. I started to run but didn't know where to run. I saw alligator's in the water. I was covering my ears and partially covering my eyes.

She had shoulder-length, black hair, parted down the middle. I get up to go to Communion. The people in the rows in front of me weren't getting up. Just as I got in line they got in front of me. The lines were all messed up like people not knowing where the lines were so I kept finding myself out of line.

221,"I was at this beautiful very large house. We were outside. The dad was there and I think five children. One child was going up the sidewalk to go in the house. Daddy told him to pick something up and take it with him. He ignored him at first then went back and got it. There was another child playing with some balls in the yard. He threw two of them and they rolled down the hill and pretty far away so he had to go after them. The others were laughing about and I told them they could go help him but hey didn't. One of the balls was a basketball. When I was inside the house, I was badly sunburned. I especially remember how badly my feet were burnt. But also my chest. Bob F said something to me about it. I was going to take a shower and Matthew said he had to be ready to go in a little more than an hour. I let him shower first but I said something to him about how he always does that, tries to squeeze in the shower right when I am ready to do so. I was little miffed at him over it. There were these people there talking about how I dressed and how I should dress more attractively. This one couple came up and were dressed in these very elaborate colorful clothing. They were obviously in love, playing and having fun with each other. I went to my room and pulled out a short satin robe to put on. I wondered if I should put something on under it while waiting for the shower. Or if I should just wear it as is.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-05-03),-0.24713099,-0.25892547,-0.17562886,0.015925642

When it was my turn, they took that away and left only vegetables and prunes. I said I wanted some of that meaning the cobbler but she ended up giving me a plate of something that looked like huge green beans. At first she started putting them on a very small plate but then she put them on a larger plate. She put the prunes on their plates too. When I went to sit down with Lilly H and Tonya H, I saw they were with a bunch of family members. I thought they should have told me if they were coming with family and I wouldn't have come along. I went back and tried to find my purse and couldn't. I finally found someone who was working there and asked her. She told me she had hidden it to keep it safe for me. I was so grateful.

226,"It seems we started out someplace where there was a lot of snow. There was a big crevice in the snow like a crack from an earthquake. I wanted to get down in the crevice and have someone take a picture for my audition video, but I couldn't fit in. Someone thinner than me did fit in. I noticed that the crevice started closing up. Someone and I kept pushing against one side of it to try to move it and keep it open. We were trying to rock it, the way you would a car stuck in mud. There was water on the other side of the crevice. As we rocked it the water started splashing over and all of a sudden we wanted to turn and run away before the water got us. When we turned around, we realized we had to swim to get back to land. We did. I was in someone's home and had emptied a 2-liter soda bottle. I took it to the woman of the house and asked her where the trashcan is so I could throw it away. She didn't understand me because she did not speak English. Someone else came up, interpreted for me, and told me where to take the bottle, which I did. One member of the tem came out with a squirt gun filled with hot sauce. She was squirting everyone. None of us liked that because we wearing the only clothing we were able to take with us and now it had hot sauce on it. We went and washed it off as best we could. I went to use the bathroom twice. The bathrooms were very unusual. I thought I better get used to it because soon I would only have the great outdoors to use. Oddly, I thought that would be better than this. We were in a restaurant. I was sitting a table with four other women. I was sitting in the middle of two of them. Two sitting across from e. The waiter came and took orders from three of them but didn't ask the other two of us if we wanted anything. The woman sitting next to me asked if they had anything decaf. He said, No! So she said she didn't want anything. At that point, I said I didn't either if they didn't have anything decaf. Later there were several of us standing around talking. One of the women looked like she was six or seven months pregnant. She was saying when her delivery could happen, that it might happen while we are out. I said, we might be delivering a baby there. She started saying something and pushing on her stomach and pulled out a huge sweater. She had just been playing around, teasing us. Myself and one other woman were walking around a wooded area. There was no snow on the ground. We were looking at pieces of bark lying on the ground. We were talking about how that would work really well to build a shelter. I was walking along what seemed to be a beach. I reached down and ran my hand through the sand because it was so pretty. I realized that it was more like gravel. It was very smooth and felt good to the touch. I was running along and running my fingers through this gravel. As I progressed, the gravel got larger and larger to where it was just these very smooth stones. All of us got into three cars. Two cars had four people each and one car had five people.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-05-04),-0.19255055,-0.17472664,0.19452406,0.14799917
231,"I was downloading software and trying to send an IM to Daddy. Maybe I sent it to Mother and he answered. He was going to tell me how to finish downloading my software. It turned out not to be a problem but I realized I didn't get back to him after that, so I sent another IM. This one I sent to Mother. I'm at Mother and Daddy's at the old house. She is sitting in the kitchen at her computer and I walked by and the computer screen is facing me and I comment about how dirty her computer screen is and that it needs to be cleaned. I wiped it with my fingers but then I went and got some paper towels and Windex and cleaned it for her. I don't know if I said this or if I just thought it. I think I said it. This is one thing I will definitely clean when I see it needs to be cleaned. Then I'm back at my computer at home and realized I hadn't continued my IM conversation with Mother. I type in something about being sorry because I had to leave to go get some milk. I'm back now. I'm in my car, again, and headed home. There's a computer keyboard and monitor in front of me where the steering wheel is. I'm driving and having a really hard time seeing the road. I thought to myself, how do I normally see around or over this thing? I can't see the road so I'm trying to look around it. I'm raising myself off the seat so I can look around the monitor and see the road. I think, maybe if I raise the seat higher. I don't usually. So what's different? There's a car pulling a huge trailer across a one-lane wood bridge. I don't see it in time. I drive off the road and around the bridge and back onto the road. The road then turns into an unusual looking railroad track. Then I think, oh, great now I'm driving on a railroad track. I'm driving on a railroad track and up a mountain. I'm thinking, this is so weird and the worst part is that it is not a dream because I know I'm not dreaming. I keep going and then I can see the vehicle that I'm driving going up the mountain but it has like four other vehicles or trailers attached to it that it is pulling. It runs into the train and starts pushing the train up the mountain. I'm talking to this man, I'm complaining about the whole incident with the train and the bridge. I have this toy-size car and trailers that I was driving. I show him what happened driving up the mountain. I tell him it was entirely his fault because I had called his company to come to the house/farm and do something and he didn't do it. I'm demonstrating backing all this down the mountain and back to my property. Football players and one of the players crossed the end zone. As he got there, he jumped in the air, turned around, and caught the football. I think it was me. As I was having it, I was thinking, oh, I'm not awake yet, I need to make sure I record it.

Anthony Edwards was my instructor and I only had about five lessons. The last one is the one I remember most.

Before my lesson, I got in a simulator and practiced. At first, I was terrible. I would go up really fast and down really fast. It was really awful. I practiced enough to get the nuance that by the time it was time for my lesson I did really well. After that, I found out that I passed, that I was now a certified pilot, and that I was one of the best in my class.

240,"I was doing a dream group for family. Aunt H, Aunt P, Aunt J, cousins, women from St. Joe, Aunt A, and some of my own family. I was at Mother and Daddy's house. I went up to school to get a few things and finish putting my materials together and stuff. I then went to the church and realized that I must be late because there were so many cars in the parking lot. I looked at my watch and it said 3:77. I knew I must be 20 minutes late maybe. Someone met me outside and took me into a side door of the church but it ended up being this big meeting room. Paulette W and her son were there also. He was playing video games and stuff right behind me. She said she hoped it wouldn't be a problem. Of course, I couldn't say anything. I handed out the folders. There was a TV playing and I realized I kept getting distracted by the TV. I was supposed to be conducting this group and I kept finding myself doing nothing more than standing there watching this TV. I suggested we turn the TV off and yet later I realized the same thing was happening again. I don't know how the TV got turned back on. I was feeling disorganized and my thoughts were very fragmented. It wasn't going well at all. I was back outside and going back inside. This time the church looked different. Big white church with very steep or deep white cement steps. I started to walk in but my eye was really bothering me. I couldn't see out of it. I was becoming less stable on my feet. Alan K walked up and opened the door for me. I walked in and had my hand over my bad eye. I was walking slowly and stepping carefully. I couldn't use one of the steps because it was too wobbly and I couldn't see well enough. He took my arm and helped me find my way to the bottom of these steps and to a step. Then I told everyone what was going on with my eye and I felt like I was getting a cold and I was just feeling that it wasn't going well at all and I really didn't like that. Having said all that, I hope you don't mind but I'm going to go ahead and put this on. It was a beige and navy blue baseball cap. It had something written on it but I don't know what. At first, it fell down over my eyes. I pushed it up some and tucked it behind my ears so it would stay. I couldn't tighten it. I resumed talking. I was talking about different kinds of window shades not about dreams. We were in Aunt P and Aunt H's house. Not their waking life house. It was very large and beautiful. They had in one area where I was standing to give the talk I could see five different windows. I was talking about how they had used different treatments and different fabrics on each window, I commented on how well coordinated it was and how good that combination went together. Then I reached in my box of stuff and pulled out some very small, maybe one inch in diameter fabric samples for vertical blinds. I asked if they had vertical blinds but just as I asked I saw that they did. They were kind of like a lacy flower pattern. Very pretty and I commented on the same. I asked them if she had help with the decorating or if she had done it all themselves. They said they had some help. Then we continued talking. Kendall B walked up to join the group and he took a seat. I introduced him, looked at him, said should I tell them now or later who you are. He just grinned and didn't say anything so I decided to wait until later. I was still feeling really uncomfortable, as though it wasn't going well. The TV was back on again and I was trying to get them to turn it off and leave it off. I whispered to Kendall B that I had some great things to show him about my research. He just grinned again and walked away to find a place to sit and observe my group. I was still feeling that it wasn't going well at all. I wasn't prepared. I was very ill at ease. I said I like to leave lots of time for questions because people have lots of questions. I started taking questions at that point. We were having some great discussion. We got off track from time to time talking about dreams. I realized from some of the questions that I was pretty well prepared so I felt less nervous about Kendall B hearing my answers to these questions.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-05-28),-0.08508434,-0.31724873,0.08904161,0.0005440403
241,"I was at a hotel with family and friends but I'm not sure why. It might have had something to do with graduation. We were chatting with some people about Matthew graduating. He walked up and we were chatting a little bit. He knocked on somebody's room door and one of his friend's came out and his friend was trying to teach me to do this thing with my hands. Then they took off and Matthew came back and had picked up some mail for us at the front desk. It was a bunch of letters, a fed ex package, and a big box. None of them were for us. It wasn't the address of the hotel and it wasn't our name. I took them back down to the front desk to let them know that they were in our mailbox. They apologized and said they would take care of it. I told them the other box was still upstairs because it was sports equipment and it was too heavy for me to bring down. When I went back upstairs, it was sitting with some other things for them to take downstairs. As I was walking through the hotel, someone tapped me on the shoulder from behind. I turned around. It was two women and a man. The woman in the middle was tall, with glasses, blonde hair, and older. She reached down, hugged me, and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I didn't know who she was but I acted as though I did. I said, hi how are you? We chatted a little bit. Then the three of them went into the restrooms. I realized that they were from DDSI. I walked a little ways trying to find the DDSI meeting. I figured there must be a meeting there. I found it and I went in. There was a table at the front that Vince P, Joanne N, and probably the area coordinators were sitting there. I went up and just crouched down on the floor at the end of the table. Diane S was sitting at the end of the table. She said, since she had the baby she was just doing DDSI full time. She wasn't giving the small jobs to a decorator anymore. We talked about her husband a little bit. She had been sitting next to Vince P. I put my hand on his shoulder and pulled him towards me. I said you haven't been returning my phone calls. He said, yes, I know. I said what's going on with that. He said things are different now. I said what does that mean. He said the last message you left you were kind of coming on to me. I said, no I wasn't. He said, well things are different now. He wouldn't even talk to me any more than that. I finally decided that I was going to leave. I leaned over to Joanne N and asked her if there was anything she needed from WDF right now. She said not that she was aware of. I said, Okay. I can't stay because I'm not feeling well. However, I wanted to check in. Then one of the other coordinators stopped me before I left and opened a sample book to a fabric and asked me to find out if we have it in orchid and then she closed the book right away. I reached for a pad of paper and a pen. I had this little bitty pen, the size of my fingertip. I needed her to open the book back up so I could write down the fabric. I wrote down the page. As I was doing this, I realized that this was silly. Of course, it doesn't come in orchid. If it did, it would be in the sample book. I didn't say anything because I had already made her think I didn't know that already and that I was going to check on it. I wrote down the name of the sample book. I said that is just really beautiful fabric. It was shiny, satiny soft. Really nice fabric. She said, yes it is. Then two other people had some things for me so I wrote them down. Then I left and I realized I was barefoot. I don't know why. When I left, I was in a hall surrounded by doors. There was no way out except to go through one of these doors. I couldn't find the door that I just came through. I was looking in some of the doors and there were other meetings. I was trying to find my way out. I finally did, but I don't know how. As I was walking away, I ran into Tim W. He was saying something to me about still representing WDF. He said we have their business now, so we don't really need you. If I were you, I wouldn't do it. You aren't getting paid for it, and we have their business. He called me boy, or son, or something equally ridiculous. He shrugged his shoulders and walked away. At that point, I thought about not even turning in the notes I had. That wouldn't look good for me or for them. I also thought about what would happen down the road if I didn't do that. As I was walking through the hotel, there were many young women in beautiful white dresses. They were all alone. I wondered if there was a debutante ball going on. Then I saw a stage area where a lot of them were gathered. There were five of them performing but they were in pink dresses. I thought that's not a debutante ball, because they don't wear pink dresses.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-05-30),-0.29487306,-0.14803013,0.038239367,-0.1342982
242,"Jennifer K came over. We were at mother and daddy's house. She came over to visit. She was telling me that her mother wanted to buy Matthew this huge toy for out in the yard. Toy for lack of a better thing to call it. I don't remember what she called it. It was going to be 24 x 12 feet, all plastic, enclosed, netting for safety. The kids could go in and jump in it and stuff. When mother was thinking about it, Jennifer K was in this tent thing that was zipped up and hanging from something in the house. I could tell mother wasn't pleased. I unzipped the thing that Jennifer K was in and she poked her head out. We talked about it a little bit more. I don't think Mother ever answered us. I don't remember Jennifer K leaving or anything. After she was gone, I was helping mother do some dishes. There was syrup all over the kitchen counter. Mother had walked away. I saw the syrup and I was starting to clean it up. She walked back so I stopped and went back to drying dishes. I told her that the syrup was there. She started rubbing a little bit. She got upset and stopped. I started again. I had put warm water on it and it had gotten hard like wax when it is cooling. I could peel it up very easily. I took those pieces and started peeling them up. She asked me how I knew to do that. I said that I just tried it. Something else about Jennifer K. We had placed something in the refrigerator, then we pulled it out laid it on the counter. I think that's where the syrup came from. After we finished the dishes, Bob F and I were standing in the kitchen. Mother came in and leaned her back against the counter. BJ came in. We knew that she was pregnant and she said she just wanted to ask us a question. She was thinking about getting an abortion. I said, how about if I invite this one priest, a family friend but not from the parish and not Father M, Father So and so to Matthew's party. Then you would have a chance to talk to him about it there. She said, oh, that would really be wonderful. I had a stuffed animal. One of the kids came out. I don't know if it was Rachel S or Bev as a little girl. I said Father so-and-so is coming to Matthew's party. She was excited. I said, so make sure you remember to bring him. Only I was talking about the stuffed animal, too. I was putting up Christmas lights on the outside of the house. It wasn't my birth home or my parent's house now. Then after I did that we all got bundled up, I don't remember everyone that was with us. I thought it was my Mother. It was Kay H and she was my Mother. We were going to a family Christmas party or something and we walked. Not all of the Christmas lights were working and I was kind of upset about that. I realized it was my fault because I didn't check all the bulbs before I put them up. I didn't even test them after I got done. I realized I had to go back out and work on them, fix them, the next day. As we were walking, we were crossing the street and there was something like a Christmas parade going on. It was dark outside. We went ahead and crossed the street just walking around some of the people marching in the parades and floats. They were almost like Disney characters or things that you would see in a cartoon. I can't make a good description at all. While I was walking around this, I was thinking, this is so cool. It's just like a dream. Then I said, it reminds me of that one other dream I had, with the Disney-like village. As we were walking there were also these kind of like booths, they were like little play houses. I walked up to the first one and they said, you can try to win a prize. They hand me this little cube, and they asked me a question. I had to show what kind of cube was the right answer to the question. I had to get all three questions right to win a prize. I got the first one wrong but they kind of cheated and gave me a clue and let me try again. Then I got it right and the next two right. For the prize they handed me a little film container with something in it. I didn't look to see what was in it. I was going to look at it later. I just stuck it in my purse. As I was walking, I saw that someone else had been playing something like a card game at one of the little houses. When I got to the house that person was done so I walked up and asked what she was doing. She had an option of a couple of different games. One game was like pictionary. One you could throw rings on a bottle. She said it was one dollar. I pulled out a five-dollar bill and then she said it's only 15 cents. I said, but you said it was a dollar. She said I'm trying to give you a deal. Just give me 15 cents. I didn't have 15 cents so I just gave her a dime. The game she brought me was like a puzzle where I looked at this vertical row of five things. Then she took it away and I had to pick up these pieces of the puzzle and put them in the same order. I didn't get it quite right. The second from the bottom thing was a cow but the cow on hers didn't look like any of the cows on mine. I told her that and so I said that wasn't fair. She said, just a minute let me give you your five dollars back. I don't remember her giving it back to me. They were closing for the night so we were rushing to get out of the way. They were rushing trying to lock up their little houses. I had someone else with me but I don't remember who it was. We ran because everyone else had gone ahead and I was kind of afraid we would get lost. Whoever was with me, I think it was an older Matthew, I asked him if he remembered how to get to grandma's house and he said he thought he did. We got there fine without any trouble. I don't remember being at grandma's house. When we were coming back, we were all driving separately. I got to this one place on the way back, there was kind of like a metal fence in a kind of fence. There was just a couple of inches of the fence sticking out of the ground and you had to drive over it into the maze, through this fence to the other side to get home. When I got in, I lost control of the car and I kept stomping on the brakes. It wouldn't stop. There were a bunch of other cars parked in there and I couldn't believe I didn't crash into any of them. I couldn't get control of the car and I couldn't get it to stop. Then it started turning back and sliding the other way, the way that I came from, and finally as I got to where I entered this place I was able to get control again and drive on out. I was the owner of the property. I could hear him yelling that someone was ruining his fence and he was going to get them. He was going to come out and I heard him yelling. Even as I was getting away, I heard him yelling that they got away but he was going to come after them. I got away. Then we were walking up the yard. Apparently, this was a very new house because there were huge piles of dirt and stuff out front. The outside of the house looked like plywood but there were full-grown evergreens too. We talked a little bit about that, something about the house and things that still needed to be done to finish the house.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-05-31),-0.2407166,-0.086486116,0.19689661,-0.081297494
246,"I was at Margie D and Dennis D's house. It was a house in the country with a lot of land. I was walking up to the house with Margie D up this winding driveway. We had to duck under some of the trees occasionally. There were some flowering trees. It was hilly land. I remember that there was a lot of stuff out there but I don't remember what it was. We went in the house and I saw Dennis D. I commented that he was looking good. While I was standing there I was thinking about the fact that I had just heard that he had quit his job once to stay home with the kids. I remember when he kind of made a pass at me while they were dating and I was thinking about that too. I acknowledged the fact that it had been awhile since we had seen each other. Then two young children came out, Erin D and Dennis D Jr. Dennis D Jr. was being potty trained and was running around with no clothes on. I said something about Rachel S and her doing the same thing. Just joking around. There furniture was a eclectic, but from garage sales and stuff. The sofas and chairs were not all together. pieces on the floor. Samantha was laying in the back of a pick up truck and she was sucking on her finger. I was teasing her and I said, Yes, Miss College Graduate. She kind of grinned at me and said, Yes I need to work on breaking that habit don't I. Then I think Margie D came up. I spent the night there. I shared a bed with Margie D. The alarm was going off. I got up and was packing and getting ready to go. The alarm kept playing. I checked the alarm on my side of the bed and realized it wasn't mine. Finally, Margie D rolled over. I could tell she was getting ready to say something to me about the alarm, ask me to turn it off. I told her it wasn't mine. I didn't realize that it was actually something that I was hearing in the dream was my alarm in waking life was playing and playing and it didn't wake me. As soon as I hit the snooze button in my waking life, the music stopped in the dream. My suitcase was sitting on the bed while she was sleeping. I took my toothbrush and toothpaste and stuff that I wanted to take to the bathroom and some little stuff in one bag. I kind of moved the suitcase so it wouldn't be in her way while she was trying to sleep.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-06-07),-0.11470372,-0.04978028,-0.10278717,-0.10817704
248,"I was having my period. Twice I took a tampon out and put a new one in. I took one and wrapped it in a piece of paper no bigger than the tampon and pushed it together. I was in a car with Matthew and two other girls. Matthew was supposed to be taking one of them to the prom. He was in a black tux with a white shirt and white tie. I thought I really like that he decided to go with a white tie this year. Then I found out that the girls were sisters and they were both going with him to the prom. I was driving with the two girls and someone else in the car. I was driving from the back right passenger seat and was having trouble seeing. I was looking for a place to pull off so I could change places with the person in the front left so I could see better to drive. When I tried to pull off the road I was knocking over trashcans and stuff. Even after we made the change I was still. The place that I had to go forward and try to get out of there, there were all these trash cans and I kept running over them and knocking them down trying to get out of there. I also remember something about the road. It seemed to me that it was steep and very windy. the one girl, the one that Matthew was supposed to be taking to the prom, had some kind of psychological problems. I was supposed to be her psychologist and working with her and I said I couldn't work with her because she was gay and attracted to me. Of course, the feelings weren't mutual and she got really upset. I can't remember if she threatened to hurt herself or me. I held strong and continued to.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-06-11),-0.20710799,-0.22346096,0.09169131,0.09063705
249,"I was at a CRHP meeting with CRHP XIII. While at the meeting they asked me to give my witness. I was unprepared, did not have it with me, as they did not give me advance notice. Before I got up to do it one of the CRHP XIII women got up and started talking about her wedding coming up the next weekend. There was a child, hers maybe, running around the room. The woman had very dark, short hair and was dressed in a purple suit. I decided it was going to be awhile. I realized that I had forgotten to bring any of my things to do the Maori drawing. So I told Judy that I was going to run home and pick something up and that I would be back. Judy had something on her face. It looked like a knit fabric that fit very snug and covered all of her skin. I noticed two other women wearing similar things but different colors. I asked her what happened and she said she had her face exfoliated but had not yet completed the process. I left to go home. While trying to go home I took a wrong turn and got lost. I drove quite awhile, and was out in the country, before realizing what I had done. I thought I had just turned right instead of left or vice versa. So I pulled into a driveway to turn around. For some reason my car was stopped and I just sat there. There were two gentlemen standing by a barn talking. The older gentleman finally came up to the car. As he was approaching I started the engine again and rolled down the window. I told him I made a wrong turn and wanted to go to Indy. I pointed the direction that I thought I wanted to go and he nodded that he thought that was correct. I turned around and left. I hadn't driven very far until I ran into places along the road where there were huge stacks of packages of frozen fruits and vegetables in the road making it very difficult to get through. This concerned me because I didn't recall seeing them there the first time. I kept driving and came to a dead end. I didn't see how this was possible because I hadn't made any turns along the way either time. A couple of gentleman came out and were arguing about which way I should be going. A lady came out who recognized me. She was very friendly, like we were old friends. She was a black woman. I barely remembered her. I kept trying to remember where I had met her. I walked with her a little way and through her house and I was just blocks from where I wanted to be. She was telling me about this store that I had introduced her to for great deals on bed linens. I finally decided that I knew her from SVH. She worked at the front desk. Her name was Sue Ann Williams. She was a black woman, very friendly and kind. We went into the store and she was showing me different things. I realized how much I wanted to have an income again. As we were walking outside again, I told her I wanted her opinion on something I had just done. I told her that I had just moved out of an apartment that I love because of money. I went from a 3 BR with an upper deck and a large LR to a 2 bedroom with a small LR. The cost saving was $400. However, as I was talking to her I realized that I had not given my current owners one month notice so it was going to cost me an extra month rent there. I also realized that we had not moved anything off of the patio, upper deck or two downstairs closets. I had no idea how we were going to fit all of my things into this smaller apartment. Plus, I love this apartment and was miserable about moving into this new place that was smaller and white walls, etc. She wouldn't say much. She said it was time for her to go to bed. She climbed into a row of beds along the street. But they were my shoulder height and they were all attached to each other. Tonya H came up and climbed in next to her. I grabbed a blanket and covered Tonya. I exchanged some pleasantries with Tonya but don't remember what it was about. As I was walking away I was thinking that I would need to get help to move the rest of my things into the new apartment. Then I had the idea that I would just find help to move my things back into the old apartment. that I would find a way to be able to afford to stay there. I went into this retail store that had offered me a job making $41,500 a year but I had turned them down because it wasn't what I wanted to do. I walked into the store and the lady I had originally spoken with was standing there and asked me if I had made my decision as though I had not already turned her down. I verified the income and then said that I would like the job. There were several other employees standing around that didn't seem to like that I was coming to work there. One was trying to put up a good front at least. The manager was very happy and went to get the paperwork. I was trying to tell myself that it was going to be fine and at least it would relieve my financial burden and worries. I'm having difficulty figuring out where the actual apartment move came into this. But I distinctly remember us doing some of the moving. We were at the new apartment with boxes all around us. I walked into one room and BJ was disappointed because she was trying to have that whole room unpacked before I saw her. She was almost done. After she left I started moving things around because she had the things that I use the most in low hard to get at cabinets and things I seldom use in the easy-to-get-to cabinets. This one wall was wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling cabinets, much like in Mother's kitchen.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-06-16),-0.2037854,-0.10126421,0.092027366,-0.13412146
250,"I was in my mother's hometown for business for a couple of days. Bev lived there and I went and visited her for a little while. I was feeling restless so I told her I was going to drive by Aunt P's and Aunt H's. It was 9:10 p.m. I said I bet they go to bed at 9 or 9:30 but that's okay. I'll just drive by and see if they are still up. If they are I might stop in for just a little bit. As I was driving there were these people outside and they had these big balloons, maybe 2-3 feet in diameter. There was a place that was roped off and the balloons were on string like maybe helium filled. I thought that maybe it was students doing some kind of a weather project. I went on over to their house and the lights were on. I saw them both sitting in the living room with their pajamas on. I stopped and knocked. Aunt H answered the door and was very surprised to see me. She thought that maybe something was wrong. I said, no I was just in my mother's hometown for a couple of days and I just stopped by to say hello because I saw you were still up. I sat and visited with them for a little bit and then left. As I was going back to my hotel, I guess, I stopped where these people were working with these balloons because there were more people there now. I asked them what they were doing. They were growing babies. There were all these babies born only with the head. They would take the heads and attach something that would grow a body. Then they put them in this balloon to allow the body to grow. They would float these heads in these balloons until the bodies grew.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-06-16),-0.16198693,-0.23321484,0.16365628,-0.015190696
253,"Mother and BJ wanted me to have my annual check-up at a hospital other than SVH's. I went to satisfy them but was very upset the whole time. they wanted me to partially undress and have the rest of my exam in these area where passers-by could see me. I got very angry and decided to leave. I was hurrying around looking for my winter coat and handbag. They were saying things like I was overreacting and being silly. I just grabbed my things and left. very angry. As I left I saw, through a window accessible to all, a pregnant woman being examined. I went back to SVH's. I parked my car in a lot four blocks away. I was with someone but I don't know whom. There were several cement walls about waist high. It seemed to be in a bad part of town. The environment was not at all like SVH North Campus. not the surrounding area or the building itself. I went to the elevators to go to an office but I'm not sure where I was headed. It was a six-sided self-standing elevator. that is, not encased in a wall. The outside was all gold and very ornamental. I wanted to go to the 2nd floor. The elevator closed without me so I grabbed something on the outside and let it carry me up one floor like that. Meanwhile, other people were waiting on the first floor for the standard elevator. I'm not sure if I got where I was going. I was walking around and noticed there were a lot of people around. It now felt more like we were in a hotel lobby. I realized there was some kind of trade show or something going on. I decided to go check it out. While I was walking in I realized all of the vendors were just setting up. I was going to look for the WDF booth and thought that I should call someone and see if Marcia N could come and work the booth. As I was walking around I saw booths for people like CFC, only they had a different name now. I realized they had merged with another company and changed their name. Then I saw my own booth. I realized then that WDF did not have a booth and that I had forgotten I had signed up to do this. I went over to my booth space and the only thing there was a three-panel cardboard background that someone had placed there for me. It was very unprofessional and sloppy looking. It had two handmade signs that had been made by Jane Cr for one of my Happenings programs. They were cloud shaped and had been written using several colors of markers. I was thinking about what I would need to get set-up. The booth next to me was just the same, I think it was an insurance agent. I knew her. She was asking me what I typically do for these shows. I explained to her and then told her I was just on my way home to pick up materials before the show starts. My booth was in a corner. Don H was running the show. I told him I needed a table and tablecloth. He took a corner table piece and tablecloth from another booth. I grabbed an extra chair that didn't seem to be in use. The other vendor also had ice and soft drinks which I accidentally moved an ice cooler and a big bowl of ice to my booth. I went and returned them. When I came back someone else had placed cups of ice and 2-liter bottles of soft drinks at my booth. I realized whoever was sponsoring the event was placing them at all the vendors booths for the attendees. I was thinking about what literature to bring and how to make the most of this show. I thought I would offer a free mini interpretation for people and then have those names to add to my mailing list. I also realized that I might need to print and create some materials at home before I returned. I was aggravated for not being prepared already. Two people who were attending the show came to my booth before I could leave to get my materials. I talked to the two of them a bit. I told them I normally charge $50 for a dream interpretation but today, they could sign up to get a mini-interpretation done free if they signed up for the mailing list. The younger woman immediately wrote a check for $15. Apparently she misunderstood me. Her check was like a business check. I realized instead of giving the interpretations free at this show that I should sell them for $15. That way I would make some money for it and they would have more value for the show attendees because they had paid something for it. I was glad this had happened when it did to inform my decision. I was looking for something to write on to give her my name and address, as I didn't even have my business cards with me yet. The woman she was with, I think it was her mother, decided to have one done too. While they were doing that they had a little dog running around like crazy. I was trying to stop him so I could pet him. At times he would kind of jump up on me, on my leg because he was so small. He reminded me of Janet C dog that I called a rat dog. About the height and length of a cat, yet smaller body. Very short haired. He was dark brown and black. When I left to get my materials it was pouring down rain. I wondered why I hadn't brought my umbrella in with me. I bent over and was protecting my head with a paper. Along the way I realized that even though it was raining very hard, I didn't seem to be getting wet. I got to my car, went home and came back. Again I forgot my umbrella. When I got inside I realized I had only picked up one of quite a few things that I needed and that I needed to leave again. The woman in the booth next to me had changed our booths so she had the corner spot. I switched them back. When she came up she said something to me. I told her I paid for a corner booth because it is better exposure. I guess I must have walked away because when I came back she had taken over the corner again. This time she had moved in all of these big items for an elaborate display. I was sandwiched in between her and another large display. I now had one straight table and it was sitting sideways to fit in between the other two. You couldn't even see my display. I found Don H again and was very upset about this. I told him I wanted it fixed and wanted my corner back. He tried to explain to me why she needed the corner and that it had something to do with client privacy. I don't remember my response, but basically I wanted my corner back. I told him that he had about an hour to fix it. He said he couldn't believe I would say that. I explained that I simply meant I had to go home to get the rest of my materials so he had an hour to figure something out. The woman in the insurance booth was ignoring me now- obviously she didn't want to interact with me after what she had done. The man on the other side of me was trying to make me feel better about my space. I overheard Jane Cr and someone else saying that wasn't right what was happening to my space. They acknowledged that my service is very popular to people and that it deserved the right space. I left again to go home and get materials. It was still raining very hard and I wondered again why I had not remembered my umbrella. Again, even though I was simply holding a paper or something over my head I noted that while my body was not protected from the rain it was not getting wet. This time I couldn't find the lot where I parked my car. I went to it from the other side of the block but then the surroundings weren't familiar so I couldn't find it. I came across several businesses, some with overhangs where I could be protected from the rain for short periods of time. I think one was a hotel and two were fast food restaurants. I think one was KFC. I don't know what the other was. I was getting very frustrated because I couldn't find my car. I finally went to the other side of the block, thinking that I should be able to find it that way. I think I did find the right lot just before I woke up.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-07-01),-0.2608097,-0.15787682,0.16942516,0.094619825
256,"I had a dream group meeting. There were nine people there. Louise H, Sophia K, Dan M, Lou S, the others I don't remember. Mark M was not there. I was getting very sleepy towards the end of the meeting. Our discussion got way off track. I said something about this being a very interesting conversation. It could go on for hours, especially when you talk about multiple personalities and the fact that if they have MP do they also have multiple souls and multiple spirits or some combination. I was having a very hard time keeping my eyes open while I was saying that. After the meeting was over I thought everyone was gone and I went to pick up the money. I thought there would be $90 but there was only $3. I was very upset and realized I didn't say anything about them leaving their money before they left so it was my fault. Still, I was disappointed that not even Lou S, Dan M and Sophia K left their money. Surely if they had left theirs, the others would have done likewise, and those three know the routine by now. Still, it was my fault. Matthew was helping me put the chairs away. There were two little yellow rocking chairs, like I have in waking life, and one adult size, like them. I said I don't even know where the extra two came from. He asked me where the one blue chair went and then two or three people came out of the kitchen. One was a very dark-skinned woman from India who had her hair and face completely covered. I asked if she had paid yet and got the sense that there was going to be some kind of problem.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-07-08),-0.004781969,-0.10368017,0.028011126,-0.12534547
259,"I went to church. When I went up to receive the Blood of Christ, the Eucharistic Minister was trying to use a new phrase and she couldn't remember it. She was mumbling and kind of being flippant. Finally she just said, oh well, The Blood of Christ and then just continued using that phrase. I was standing in back when church let out and I was trying to push my way through the crowds to get to someone (or something) quickly. before I missed them or it. Matthew and I are in the car. He is driving. We were behind some buildings and he was going to park right behind a bunch of emergency vehicles. fire engines and ambulances. I told him he couldn't park there but that he could park anywhere else along the building. We never did park. The next thing I saw were people going through kind of a drive-thru window for something but it wasn't a restaurant. I told Matthew to drive around them and leave. As we were getting ready to leave we saw a young black man giving someone in another car something that looked like aspirin from this giant bottle. He approached our car. I was curious so I told Matthew to stop. He gave us two and it turned out they were batteries that looked like aspirin. He gave us a bottle of them. the size of a regular aspirin bottle. As we left I was telling Matthew what an ingenious marketing idea that was. Now I'm driving, and really fast because Matthew was going to be late for work and he had to get home to change before going to work. I sped through a yellow light. I accidentally drove through a red light. As soon as I realized what I did and ran three more in a row. I couldn't seem to help it. I was finally able to stop the car, a screeching stop, for the last one. At that time I realized there was a police car ahead of me, but he didn't do anything. We're at the church office. There were three desks sitting in the lobby. I thought it was odd the way they were set up because two of them, the two in front, had their backs to the door and where people would come in. Matthew and I had gone into the back of the church and brought some things into the office. Matthew was sitting at one of the desks typing something that he needed to leave there. It was due or overdue. Just as he thought it was done he realized he had typed it in all caps so he had to retype it. While he was doing that Julie O came out and I commented about the desks- that she had gotten that beautiful new desk unit and now they took it away and put these desks there. I didn't tell her what I thought of the two that had their backs to the door. She made some comment to say that this was a good thing. Of course she would, whether she really thought so or not. That would be the nice Christian thing to do. I was giving two other women that came out the other things that I had carried into the office from the back of church. The paper bag had things in it that people had been making in the back of church. They reminded me of valentine things but were very large, made out of large colored paper. I said I didn't know what they were but that they kind of looked like Valentine things. They were puzzled by that but then mentioned something about Alice S and I said, yes, she would be working on that about now. So they took the bag. After they took it I found some others lying on the floor. I picked them up and placed them on one of the desks. One of the things is my little cedar chest that normally sits on my dresser. It was full of pictures. The pictures on the bottom were of Matthew and I. At first I told them I wasn't sure what it was and when I saw the pictures of Matthew and I on the bottom I said, Oh, now I know. Someone saw my chest sitting here with these pictures so they just put their own on top. They agreed that made sense. We saw a few of the pictures that had been added. The people were naked, some had body paint, but you couldn't see any genitals or any of the women's breasts. They took the chest and I told them that, of course, I would want the chest back. They said of course, but they didn't bring it back. As Matthew was finishing his typing I asked if I could take the chest back with me now and someone went to get it.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-07-21),-0.15731078,-0.15530828,-0.062329944,0.2330565
260,"I had just secured a job working here locally for NASA. Our quadrant was in the middle of a crisis. NASA had commercial airliners and one of the pilots had crashed a plane intentionally. At first they did not realize that he had survived until a subsequent incident. Two pilots, a husband and wife, were sent on a mission to try to stop the criminal pilot. The husband was Anthony Edwards, actor. I walked/ran with them through many of the checkpoints/security clearance points to get them securely into their aircraft. I was in training. I was trying to get security clearance and the equipment was not taking my SS number. I realized that someone had entered a 0 before the number and that was causing the malfunction. No one knew who had done it so we suspected the criminal pilot. I was the first to realize the criminal pilot had survived when I saw him reappear, almost as though it was a scene in a movie. He came up from the ground in a very surreal/ghostly manner. In another scene I was having anxiety about accepting a position with NASA. I wasn't at all sure I was up to the task. I kept telling myself that I had to give myself time to learn the ropes and I had to maintain my confidence. I met a woman who had not been working there very long. She had names in blocks on a clipboard and some were scratched out. I realized that she was fairly new, not as new as me, learning and making mistakes also. I found that very reassuring. I went to my station, standing at a piece of computerized equipment. I remembered that Raina D worked for NASA and decided to call her and let her know that I was working there. We spoke for a little bit on the phone. After getting off the phone I knew she would tell Barry C about this and that might change his mind a little about me. I decided to go to lunch. I went and changed into shorts and sandals so I could exercise on my lunch break. Raina D showed up at my station and warned me. She asked me if it was okay to take my lunch break now. She told me they are very particular about things like this. There was a gentleman working at a station right next to me that she knew. I had not been introduced to him yet. She introduced us and told me that he is a great source of information and I should ask him any questions I have. As she was telling me this I was slipping on the sandals. I saw on other people going to lunch and I saw Raina D, in particular, meeting someone for lunch. I asked the gentleman about lunchtime, length, and the appropriateness of using that time for exercise.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-07-22),-0.055543073,-0.06619632,0.0025318642,0.24250683
262,"I moved back into the house on Lakeland Drive. With Darren but not to share a bedroom. I was thinking very intentionally about this. Even though we were going to be sharing this house I certainly wasn't going to share my bed. I did think, momentarily, about reconciliation, and thought immediately. Oh, NO! NO WAY! Then I wondered why such a thought would even occur to me because it just repulses me to consider that. We bought it from Margie D and Dennis D, initially. They said they were moving and I said, maybe I should buy it from you. After I moved in it seems that there was someone else involved. I noticed that the paint in some of the rooms was still the same color as when I had owned it previously. There was a listing in the paper for the house and it said two bedrooms and a loft. I laughed that they called the third bedroom a loft because it was no different than the other two rooms. It was a one-story house. In the one room, all the walls were kind of like sponge painted. I looked up and they had done the ceiling too. I realized they had done it to look like clouds. I thought maybe I could leave the ceiling like that. Then I noticed that on the ceiling they had used stuffed animals. One of the stuffed animals was a Teddy Bear. On the walls they had made the white parts look like butterflies. In one room they had a big splotch of paint. In one room there was a framed picture attached to the middle of the ceiling. In another room there were two things attached to the ceiling, not necessarily in the middle and not aligned but a seemingly random placement. They were abstract in design but after studying them I realized they said LE1. I didn't know what this was and then someone brought a bottle of men's cologne in. It was called LE1. A man sprayed it all over himself and we still couldn't smell it. I said I hadn't heard of it before. Audrey T and Karen Mc were there. Audrey T had done something and she was embarrassed. I hugged her head and kissed her on the head and told her I loved her. The third room I was making my office. It's like I was sharing it with Karen Mc. There were several windows in that room. I was excited to get that room just the way I wanted it. It was spacious. not like in waking life. Someone had moved all the furniture in without me guiding them. I was anxious to begin moving the furniture around. I told Karen Mc and someone else how I was going to set up my desk and credenza by the window. But I was going to set up the desk so it was coming out from the wall into the center of the room. Probably have my computer facing the window. Karen Mc said she figured I would do that and since it was my house she couldn't really say anything. I said, well, maybe we can have your sewing machine by the other window.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-07-25),-0.11080638,-0.07213521,0.027153784,-0.21049413
264,"I was using a cardboard box as a car, driving through BR. People were driving on an area between the buildings and the sidewalk. It was very narrow and in waking life a car could certainly not fit on it. It kept getting more and more narrow. I thought that it was easier for my box/car than it was for people in normal cars. I got out and kind of folded the box up and continued because it became so narrow. I then realized that I was walking head on into cars coming from the other direction. So I turned around quickly and headed back the other way. I decided to go around the other side of these businesses to get where I was going. I'm not sure how it happened but my box/car got soaking wet and I was afraid it was going to fall apart. It brushed up against my bare leg. It left a dirty spot that I wiped off after pulling the box further away from me. I got to the restaurant where I was meeting someone. I unfolded it and set it up and then entered the restaurant for lunch. When I came back out it wasn't raining anymore. But I was concerned that my box/car was sturdy enough to transport both of us since it had gotten all wet. However, it now looked more like a car but not a regular car or even a convertible. But there was a portion that resembled the front seat of a car. It was very sturdy. The person with me, a woman, said it had dried out some and was good and sturdy and would be fine.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-07-25),-0.18481748,-0.15935732,0.18586801,0.10152005
265,"I had been on the phone with Doctor Pf's office. He had gotten a call from a patient who was insisting he do surgery and Doctor Pf said he wasn't a surgeon and he didn't agree with the decision to have the surgery anyway. But he said if he was going to do the surgery he had to have someone assisting him. The surgery was going to be on a little boy and the mother was being very adamant because without surgery the child could die. So I had called Doctor C to see if he would do it. It was 4:30 am when I called and he was very pleasant to talk to for that time of morning and for receiving a call at home. He said no problem. He found out from me who the patient was and where to go and then said he would be there. Later I drove to his house and I was going to spend the night there, but it was later that morning. I got there just as he was getting ready to leave. We chatted very briefly and then he kissed me on the lips and left. I was quite surprised by that, that he did that. I stayed at the house while he left to go do this surgery. I heard Sara C coming so I grabbed a blanket and lay down on the floor behind the sofa and pretended to be asleep. The sofa didn't sit next to a wall. She knelt on the sofa and looked over and saw me lying there. She said something to me and I pretended to be half-asleep. I said I was laying here reading and I fell asleep so I just stayed here. She insisted that I get up and lay on the sofa. She was on her way out. I watched her leave and was thinking that Sara C just didn't seem like the type of woman Doctor C would be married to. They appeared to be an odd couple. Although, Sara C in the dream did not look at all like Sara C in waking life. After Sara C left the boys came down, they were maybe 5-7 years younger than in waking life. It was Jeff C and Ben C although Ben C said that was not his name. I don't remember now what he said it was. It was about time for me to get up already and I had just gotten to sleep. The boys stayed there and wanted to talk and play. So I did. I talked to them and gave them a lot of attention. I realized then that I had to get ready and get to work. I had seen a shower on wheels at the bottom of the driveway. I went out and pushed it to the top of the driveway and it rolled off the edge of the driveway and into the grass. I thought that was probably too far so I pulled it back out of the grass. I was trying to figure out a way to use it so no one would see me naked. It looked like a bathtub with two walls on the ends but nothing on either side. The walls on the ends were not very wide and got narrower towards the top. I realized if I turned it one way the neighbors would see me and if I turned it the other way the cars driving by would see me. I realized that I didn't bring my shampoo and stuff with me so I was going to go back in the house to get it. At that point I saw the shower wasn't even in Doctor C's driveway but in someone else's. So I walked back into the house and I asked someone which shower I should use. They said they didn't have a shower in the house. They said there was supposed to be one in one room but Doctor C made it into his poolroom and so there wasn't one in there I could use. I really wanted to take a shower and get cleaned up before I went to work. I asked someone if I could see the house. There were quite a few people around and they weren't sure if they should let me see the house. I said I was sure it was okay because I worked for Doctor C and he and I had a very good relationship and he had invited me to see the house previously and I hadn't been able to make it. They finally agreed. This house was just incredible. Much of it had an almost sci-fi appearance to it. Contemporary! Cool! Unusual! Yet some rooms were fairly traditional. There is no way I can come close to describing this accurately. The office was fairly traditional. Very large room with lots of dark wood. Very masculine in appearance. Then we started to go into this other room. It was as if the walls had different levels to them, almost like upside down stair steps. But they kept moving. As you tried to enter an area the wall would come down and block you. I tried to get down and crawl under but didn't make it that way either. Someone said you had to push a button to stop them so you could get in. This was Doctor C's own private room and he did that so that other people couldn't get in. I finally found one of the buttons and pushed it and then saw a red door. So I held the button while I got as close to the door as I could and then made a dash for the door. I got through. I don't even remember now what was in this room. We were going from one room to another and we had to get in this monorail type of transport. The house looked like it was a city block in size and it seemed to be located in an area similar to Las Vegas. A lot of neon lights. As we were riding we were outdoors and I could see his house was hidden by lots of trees and greenery. We were going up to the 7th floor and there was a section of wall that was octagon shaped. On each section of the octagon was an elevator door and the octagon was going around in a circle. So you had to try to push the button while it was going around. I finally did. Several of the other people got in the elevator and I couldn't get in quick enough, so myself and another person got in another one that opened. Someone said room 7 to get the elevator to take us where we wanted to go instead of pushing a button on the inside. The elevator itself was shaped kind of like a space module that astronauts return to earth in. And it didn't go up and down but it went sideways and at angles. At another point we were in, maybe his playroom. He was there and not dressed at all like he would normally dress. He kissed me again and this time it was more passionate. He started to pull my blouse up and I stopped him and said no we can't do that. Things still progressed a bit. We did end up making love. Then all of a sudden I wasn't with him again and we were looking at some other rooms in the house. The ninth floor I believe. There was a big open area of marble floor and marble steps, green I think. It was a huge area and I thought this is just such a huge house. The steps here were a half circle, very wide, and fairly tall. I thought, no wonder it takes him so long to answer the door or to go from one room to another. I remember going up the steps but I don't remember where they led. There was another place in the house similar to that. I was spending time with his boys and we were playing and laughing and having a good time. They were really enjoying being with me and the attention. It was time for me to go and I wanted to hurry and leave before Doctor C saw me. So the boys were trying to help me get my things together and out to the car. As I was almost at the car, Doctor C came out.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-07-27),-0.1735395,-0.17399746,-0.3666587,-0.0024775732
266,"I woke up, in the dream, not from the dream - and got out of bed and went into the hall and noticed that Matthew's room was full of people, wall-to-wall. They were in there to watch a PHS event from the window. PHS was right across the street. Their practice football field was right outside our window. They were watching the band practice. The band was in uniform. Apparently maintenance had left my front door open so people were just coming in and sitting in Matthew's room watching the band practice. I thought, How dare they just come in here and do this. A little girl wanted something to drink. I didn't want to encourage this so I decided to take her across the street to get a drink of water. It was like we lived on a city street. She didn't like it that I did that. She was about 3 years old. I brought her back to her mother and went downstairs to the kitchen and these two young girls came in and asked if they could have some more of my chocolate chip ice cream. They were already eating some. They had taken it and put it on cookies. I thought, how dare they just help themselves to the food in my kitchen, too. I just thought that the next time I am just going to have to make sure that my door stays shut and locked so people can't come in like that. I was talking to some woman. I think she was a sister. We were talking about some place that I wanted to get a job. I said, well, it's on the same block as PHS. She acted like she either didn't know what I was talking about or didn't believe me. So I pointed out through the window. PHS looked like a city school. It was a several story, red brick building. I pointed just past it, a couple of buildings down. I said see it's that one. She said oh yes. I said, see, it's in the same block as PHS. She said yes, yes. Later she was packing all of her things and telling me that she just took a new job there. I thought, Well. How strange is that? I just got done telling her that I was trying to get a job there and now she is telling me that she has a job there. I wondered if it was the same job or maybe it would work in my benefit. Since I knew her maybe she could help me get that job.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-07-27),-0.08767619,-0.21755809,0.16027093,-0.11965665
267,"I was with the cast from friends. We found an old, abandoned boat, kind of like a cabin cruiser, and climbed on board and checked it out. I found all these compartments. It looked like solid wood blocks but sections would swing open and reveal compartments. They were all attached though. I don't know how to better describe that. Joey fixed the engine so it would run again. We started running it down this lake. We met some men that paid us to transport some things up and down the river for them. They stayed on board with us. Monica was the chef. She was baking different types of muffins. I ate one before I realized she didn't want us to. She said something about the vanilla ____ ones. That is the kind I was eating. It was chocolate on the bottom, vanilla on top and then some type of special icing. Some of realized that the men that we brought on board were drug dealers and they had us transporting drugs for them. Monica was the last one we told about this.

269,"I went to visit BJ in this new place that she was working. It might have been a school or college. It was an old building in disrepair. She was showing us around the building. I saw her poke her finger in a hole in the wall just noticing it I suppose. She was taking us somewhere. I think Bev was with some other women and me. We were going down steps and then all of a sudden we were going up steps. I noticed that she was smoking and I said something to her about that. She said, well, if you had been through some of the things that I have you would too. I responded, did I? I was insinuating that I did not start smoking as a result of any of my life tribulations. However, I was also thinking that I was being a bit dishonest because I did smoke for about three months after my divorce but no one knows that. When we were going up the steps, at the top of each flight we had to climb over a rail to get to the next flight. It was a little difficult to do. On one of them I saw another woman get over more easily and I was trying to figure out how she did that. It looked as if she just stepped down on the rail and then stepped over it. Later we were waiting to use the bathroom but there was only one. I thought I had seen another one so I went around a corner to check but there wasn't one. There were some people working in that room and another young woman that told me she was in hell year. I asked her what that meant and she said it meant she was a senior. She said it had taken her so long to get to her senior year. I told her it would be great and she should appreciate her final year. I went back out and I don't think I ever did get to use the bathroom. We went into a very large meeting or banquet room for a gathering. It was all open, no chairs or tables around. It was Christmas time. Someone was sitting with a large bag, kind of like the type you see in the Christmas movies being used by Santa. She was emptying it onto the floor. It was full of shower sandals. They were all black and the straps were glittery gold. I think there may have been some presents in it. A man drove a little tractor and trailers into the room. The trailers were full of presents. Several of us ran up to him right away but we had to move so he could get close to the tree. We were taking the presents off of the trailers and putting them under the tree and watching for the one with our own name on it. I remembered that we had submitted a list of things we would like so we would get something specific that we wanted. I noticed two toy typewriters for two of the little girls. I thought it was kind of neat that they asked for the same thing. BJ's gifts were oversized document frames with no glass in them. One of them had fallen apart and I thought that was pretty typical for document frames since they are so flimsy. there were these really huge frames with no glass in them. They were maybe 8 ft by 8 ft. They weren't wrapped. I was trying to pick them up but couldn't. I realized I couldn't because there were two men standing inside of them. One of them noticed me and stepped outside the frame but the other man didn't. I wasn't close enough to him to get his attention. I kept trying to pull the frame so it would rub against him, which it did. He kept noticing but he wouldn't move. The program had now started I guess. Finally someone else nudged him and pointed out that he was standing inside the frames and they helped me lift the frames from around him. When we were sitting the wrapped presents around the tree I was trying to set them so they looked nice. Some others were just stacking them on the floor. This annoyed me and then I realized that it wasn't worth being irritated over.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-08-04),-0.17081608,-0.17078996,0.10646077,-0.14072736
275,"I'm at the Holiday Inn at MI. I check in at the front desk. I go to get on the elevator. I had a garbage bag of clothes to be donated to Goodwill or someplace. As I was standing there waiting for the elevator two men come and stand right in front of me for the elevator. One of them has a cart and the other has a trash bag larger than mine. I told them, you know if there isn't room on the elevator after you two get on that I will be mad at you. They kind of stepped to the side and the elevator opened so I went in first. Then we don't have our trash bags anymore but there are quite a few people on the elevator. The elevator car is pretty full. It starts making noises. It is kind of jerky and moves side-to-side. Everyone is pretty nervous. I was thinking, I want to get out of here. I need to get out of here. We are headed to the 6th floor. It doesn't stop and it goes back down again. I get off at the second floor thinking that. I don't know if I didn't realize that I was not on the 5th floor. I started walking to find my room. There were several large businesses having meetings out in this open area instead of in meeting rooms. I had to walk by them to get to my room. I'm looking at them trying to figure out what the companies were. I realized one of them is LRJ. I saw Carol H. She saw me and calls out to me, then comes over to where I am standing. We say hello and hug and chat a little bit. She looks a little different, like she had gained a little weight and she was wearing glasses. We had a nice chat and she said she had to get back to her meeting. I need to go find my room so I walked away. I am trying to find my room and I realize I don't remember my room number, I don't have my key with me and I don't have my luggage. I asked someone where 650 or 620 are. They tell me I am on the second floor. That is when I realized I am not on the right floor. I had to walk past these meetings again. There is very little room to walk through. There are people sitting at the ends of the table but not up next to the table. So I had to walk between them and the table. I keep walking. One of the groups is having a sit-down dinner. At two of these tables the women are having mashed potatoes and gravy. They put potatoes right on the tablecloth instead of on a plate. I was wearing a white suit. As I walk between these women and the tables to squeeze through I get their mashed potatoes and gravy on my suit. They don't seem to care and don't apologize. One said, well, you can get that out with a little soap and water. I was nice and polite and said, Yes, I can. I went on. I get back to the elevator and really don't want to get back on because I was so scared the last time. There are other people standing there waiting also. There is a row of four elevators. Two of the elevators are standing open but there is camera equipment standing in the open. As the doors try to close they close on this equipment so they can't close all the way. The next things we see are the doors moving side to side. I started thinking Oh no. Here we go again. At first I thought maybe if I got on another elevator it would be okay but I now realize that all four of them have the same problem. I don't remember getting back on or off the elevator. I see Kendall B standing and talking to a group of people. I'm standing there looking for a little bit wondering if it is really him, because he looks a little different. His hair is a little fuller and has streaks of gray. After he finishes speaking he walks up to me and I introduce myself. He said it was nice to meet me. Then another man walks up and introduces me. At that point I realize this is his life partner. I'm talking to the two of them and quite a few children kept coming up to us. I realized it is their children. There were approximately 8-10 of different ages. His partner asked me what I do and I wasn't sure how to answer that because of my unemployment. I talked a little about my dreamwork. I told Kendall B that I had some communication with Doctor Du about the sleep positions so we talked some about that. Then Kendall B was telling me that they were there doing some work and he had to hire someone to help him. He said if I had known that I lived so close by he would have called me. I said that would have been wonderful. I was really disappointed that he hadn't contacted me. His children were doing something with videos and stuff. They were talking about going to their rooms and have TV dinners in their room. There were boxes that looked like they had about 10 videos to a box. Kendall B said, That's what we have to do. I looked at him quizzically because I didn't know what he meant. I asked, What do you have to do? He said, You don't know? I said, No, I don't. Please try to be kind when you answer me, so I don't feel even more stupid for not knowing. I don't think he or his partner either one answered me. The boxes were kind of flat and two rows of five movies each. We are outside. One of their children is reaching through a fence and trying to kill a rabbit. I said Oh no. Please don't do that. I said I have a pet rabbit at home and I would really hate to see you hurt one. So they stopped. Then this rabbit caught another animal, a smaller animal. I thought he was going to kill it to eat it. The rabbit got the animal in a position to where he could bite it in the neck and it died. I hated seeing that. I don't like to see any creature killed and I certainly don't want to witness it. Kendall B or his partner were saying, that's the cycle of nature, trying to make me feel better. Then there was a male on the other side of the fence trying to kill a rabbit. I got upset again. I thought, Please don't do that. He had already killed one but he did let that one go. I said, that kind of looks like Sir Gallahad except those have more white on them. Sir Gallahad is a Mini-Rex and his coat is really soft like chinchilla.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-08-21),-0.31389424,-0.14840582,0.20271698,0.046840314
277,"I was with Karyn L. I was in the car with her. We were on the way to pick up Carmen A and to catch a plane with the rest of our classmates to Australia. We were driving and we turned left on this street and we knew we had to turn left again. Karyn L said, This is where I always get confused. I never know exactly where to turn. She turned where her and I both thought she was supposed to. There was a car parked there. I thought there was enough room to get through. Either she didn't think there was enough room or there may have been some bars there. I was sure that was the way so she told me to go ahead and check. But it was raining. I didn't worry about that because most of where I would be walking was under cover. As I was walking I realized that there was another way that I thought she could get through. When I get through and turned around and looked I realized that it was the right place. I don't know how Karyn L ever actually got through there. We didn't just pick Carmen A up. We were in a theater. Carmen A was there with some other people. It seems that maybe some of our classmates were there. Someone was talking to us about our trip. I eventually went down to the front to sit. There were knee-deep piles of popcorn all over the place so I was eating some of the popcorn. Some of it had a lot more butter on it than others so I was reaching for that. There was an activity that we were supposed to participate in. just like a fun exercise. I don't remember what it was or what happened. Then, Daniel R showed up. He and I talked for a little bit. It was as though nothing had happened and no time had passed. I took him to introduce him to Karyn L and Mary Kay C and someone else. I was disappointed because they said hello and not much more. Karyn L got up and walked away. I was upset with Karyn L, when she met Daniel R, that she didn't grill him more or ask more questions or anything like that. I stood there and talked to him more. We walked away and continued to talk. I realized that my class was either practicing or participating in some activity on stage. I think they were practicing so I ran behind stage quick because I realized I was supposed to be there. Carmen A had on an aqua blue dress. It had an apron. She was like a waitress. Another woman yanked an apron off of her. She had two on, one on top of the other. She gave the extra to me along with a cup and a sugar jar like you would see in a diner. I set the sugar jar and the cup down while I was trying to put on my apron. I realized that my apron didn't fit well. I had to tie it around my waist and the ties weren't quite long enough. By the time I got ready the number, practice, whatever was done. We had ordered dinner to take with us. While I was waiting for this I started talking to Daniel R again. He was saying that he was going to be getting an apartment here in Indy and maybe looking for a roommate and only a female and only if it was a relationship. I think he was hinting around about it being me. I just thought that there was no way I wanted to do that again. Even being with him there was no way I wanted to be intimate with him. I was thinking that the last time I saw him he was saying the same thing. He just disappeared for a year and now he just shows up again. I was trying to pin something to my collar while I was listening to Daniel R talk to me. All of a sudden I realize that I need to go. I grab my food and run and try to catch the others. I'm not finding them. I don't remember if they left without me or if I just need to catch up with them. We had actually flown to Australia, done part of what we were supposed to do and flown back. We had less than a day and then we had to get on the plane and go again. I was thinking that if I hadn't been standing there talking to Daniel R and futzing with my collar I wouldn't have missed them. I had really mixed feelings about him being there again. There was a part of me that wanted him to stay around with me and another part that just wanted to tell him to go away and leave me alone and never come back.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-05),-0.08533982,-0.13563335,0.22777532,0.14953646
279,"I was on GC campus but with my CIIS classmates. I was talking to Terri O, asking her what to do about my class with Elisabeth K. She didn't answer me. She had some notes in a notebook that she had me copy down. I asked her if she was going to be putting it on-line and she said no and looked at me funny. I said, I'm sorry. I only asked because I thought you had previously. I was having trouble reading her writing but went ahead and started copying it. We were all sitting around waiting to leave to go home. There were two men that I was talking to. Something came up about chicken mcnuggets and they didn't know what they were. I was trying to explain it to them and I saw some sitting there. So I picked one up and took a bite out of it. As soon as I did I realized that was nasty because I didn't know who they belonged to or ho long they had been sitting there. Bonnie K was standing there at a counter next to me. I was cleaning up and putting plastic forks and spoons where they belonged and throwing some trash away. Just generally cleaning up a little bit. Then I heard we were having a burn drill. Half the people were gone already but we still went outside and had it. There was a big dip over to a high area of grass. Instead of going down and back up I just jumped across and barely made it. Where we were supposed to congregate we were supposed to form a circle but people wouldn't spread out very well. Where I was standing it was very crowded so it wasn't a single circle of people, but rather some of us were bunched up. I don't know what a burn drill is. We were supposed to sing a song. One half of the circle was supposed to sing first and then the other half was supposed to sing it. Carmen A was standing next to me and looked at me kind of funny. I don't know what that was about. Then we went back into the building. The CIIS staff was packing up and getting ready to go. They had tons of boxes of stuff sitting around all over. I made a comment that the hard part comes now, packing all that stuff up and getting back. They said they just had to take it to the basement, but, yes it wasn't a pleasant part of the job. Then Matt O walked up and I hardly recognized him. I said something to him about being dressed up. He had on a sports jacket and a tie. His sports jacket was kind of royal blue and he was wearing his glasses. But he was also wearing a toupee. black hair. that covered his whole head. I told him he looked really nice. We were talking out together. I was carrying or pulling my bags but he had a four-wheel cart full of stuff. We were walking out to catch the plane. He was teasing me about some other man wanting me. I looked at him and laughed. I put my hand on his arm and said, oh, do you Matthew? He said, Yes. I do. He kind of laughed. I apologized and said I just couldn't resist. That it was just a perfect set up. He said, no problem. Then I realized that I didn't know why he was walking with us because he was driving back to LA rather than flying with the rest of us.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-08),-0.27239683,-0.07339898,0.17358871,-0.206673
283,"I was a very young girl. I think it was me. But I have a mixed sense of whether it was me or if I was observing. I needed to find a place to live and so this man gave me an apartment in his building. He was the landlord. But in exchange I had to be with these different men and I had to get pregnant and have a baby. At first I didn't seem to mind it but I think after the baby was born he would carry us upstairs several floors to his apartment and then he would throw us down a space between the flights of steps. There was space in-between the flights of steps that just went straight down to the bottom floor. You could see all the way down from the top floor to the bottom. He would knock us down in this space to kill the baby, even though he wanted me to get pregnant and have these babies for him. I was trying to escape. My father, who is in a band, was going to take me in. I went to this apartment with my father and his band and it turns out that they wanted the same thing from me, only with them. It started out that he asked specifically who I was supposed to be with. It just wasn't working but I didn't know why. I asked my mother if she thought it would be okay if I had sex with one of the band members instead. She talked to my father and he said it would be okay. [unknown] They started playing music. I was supposed to start being romantic and having sex with this man. I went up to the one band member that I was attracted to and I started flirting with him. He was the keyboardist. He quit playing and sat there and then we went out to a car. My father followed us. He opened the car door and was very angry. But he was angry because this band member was apparently impotent. I think my mother must have intervened and calmed him down and asked him to let me try anyway. There was all of this fine powdery snow inside the car, waist high to the band member that was sitting in the driver seat. So my father used his hand and was brushing the snow out of the car and then agreed to let me try and it worked. I think my father was doing the same thing as the other man. He was trying to kill either the band member or the baby afterwards by throwing them down the same space between the flights of steps. I think either I or someone else ended up throwing him down the space in-between the steps.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-17),-0.22096775,-0.299433,-0.14100264,0.116734274
285,"I was preparing for a party to celebrate receiving my certificate for a part of my program, not my Ph.D. I was living in this big fancy house. Reminds me somewhat of Tom G and Shirley J's old house except that it wasn't well decorated, not a lot of decorations. Obviously much different than my current home. All the doorknobs were___can't describe it. I'm getting ready for this party and worrying some about it because my whole family is coming for it and I don't know where I am going to put everyone. I wanted to hide something but someone convinced me to just let it out in the open and let people know that I'm not afraid. Mother and Daddy ended up bringing most of the food for this dinner. I was going to set up my card table and folding chairs and hope that somehow we would have enough room. People started arriving and I wasn't ready yet. For some reason I was feeling very angry and I couldn't identify why. I was very upset. I went to my bedroom to change and left everyone downstairs. I came back down because I heard a terrible scream and commotion. Nicholas F was running around in a panic. Bob F was trying to gather his other children and saying, we are going to the hospital now. They weren't planning on coming back. I gave him directions to Community North Hospital because it is the closest and they can get there very quickly. All of his children had been roller blading in the street in front of my house. Apparently, someone had rollerbladed over Nicholas F's hand and cut it very severely. Bev came up to my bedroom after I had returned there to try again to change my clothes. She talked to me a little bit. I apologized for how I had been talking earlier that day and told her that I had been in a really bad mood and not even sure why. I didn't tell her this but I was thinking that part of the reason for my mood was Nick R. I finished dressing and went downstairs. Everything was ready. The BBQ they had made. I had started making mashed potatoes and that was there. Dessert was there, etc. I had to go back upstairs for something and called downstairs to Bill F and asked him to get the folding table and chairs out of the coat closet. In the meantime, Bev, Mother and BJ were getting the food on the table. While I was upstairs I was talking to someone and asked if anyone had heard from BJ. Then I said oh, yeah, duh. She's here. Then I asked about the rest of her family. Todd A was the only one that was there. Nobody knew if the rest of her family was coming or not. So, we were ready to eat and I grabbed my lighter because I wanted to light a bunch of candles all over the house. I was trying to do that while other people were getting their food. Darren was there for some reason and he had invited his family. But they were all older black people. They were bothered by Bob F's children and the other children running around, playing, and creating a commotion. I was talking to Mother and Daddy about Darren and his family being there. I asked them if they thought we had enough food. It seemed to me that they were planning on eating. Daddy said we would just have to wait and see. Upstairs I was trying to light a candle on a little round table like I have in my bedroom in waking life. There was a leg missing on it or something that was preventing it from standing level and from standing on it's own. So I couldn't get the candle lit there. I had difficulty lighting some of the other candles as well.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-19),-0.25039837,-0.10953455,0.15873244,-0.11603542
286,"Someone was trying to break into my house through the front door. I realized that I did not have the alarm set, even though the dead bolt was set and the chain was on. They were trying to break the wood. I was leaning against the wood of the door to try to keep them out and I reached up and set the alarm. As they heard it beeping to set they took off. I looked out the peephole and saw that it was three young males all dressed in black. As they took off they had to run over a huge pile of rubble in my front yard that resembled the piles of rubble rescue workers are going through in NY right now. While I was dreaming I thought that's what it looked like. I realized the alarm wasn't working because it didn't set. I ran and got my phone to call 911. They came back and started trying again. I called 911 and could hardly speak. They found something to unlock the deadbolt. I managed to turn it back again and hold it against their efforts to unlock it again. Then I saw the chain was off and reached up and refastened it. I looked through the peephole again and one of the young men was looking through the hole back at me. I wasn't sure if he could see me. I kept to one side and was looking out at an angle. I slowly moved my finger across the hole to be sure he wouldn't see me. They seemed to be making progress at getting the wood in the door to give. I placed my back against the door where they were trying to make it break in and then I placed my feet against the steps directly across from the door. I thought this would keep them from being successful.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-19),-0.14089987,-0.21255587,0.19140406,0.28279632
288,"I was in bed listening to an audio book. Matthew came in and lay down behind me and put his arm around me. I took the headphones off and asked him if he was okay. I could hardly speak so I had to ask him three times. I don't know if he answered me. Then we were in a car driving to my parent's house. Matthew was younger now-maybe 12 or 13 years old. He was asleep in the car. As we approached my parent's house I realized we hadn't eaten yet so I decided to drive to Oldtown to get some fried chicken. Matthew woke up and was upset because I was going to do that. It was about 3 a.m. and I asked him if he wanted breakfast instead but he didn't answer me. I told him it wouldn't take long. I found my way even though I wasn't sure I remembered how to get there. It didn't take as long as it would have in waking life and the roads to get there were different than in waking life. The place to park came up on me quickly so I quickly diverted off the road into a roadside parking area. When I got out of the car Matthew was already out and had crossed the street to a house. It was dark but they had lights on. I saw the door open and saw my family, particularly daddy, sitting inside. I wondered whose house that was and why they were in there. I didn't even think about why Matthew went there or knew to go there. As I entered the house, Mother met me and started talking to me about people with ADD and how other people misunderstand them and misinterpret their words or actions and don't give them enough credit for how intelligent they are because of that. I wondered why she was telling me that and wondered if someone had told her about my having ADD. I was also still wondering who the house belonged to and had a sense that the family had gone together and bought this house for me to make up for things in my life. I quickly realized, however, that the house was BJ's new house and they were just moving in. Matthew and I went to the refrigerator and found some kind of green fruit juice. I had to kneel on the floor to get it and got dirt on my black pants. We then went in and sat in the living room. Jody S was talking about ADD like she was an expert on the subject. I realized she was quoting the audio book I had been listening to but she wasn't giving the author credit. I was upset and thought that wasn't right that she wasn't giving credit to the author. I finally stood up and walked a little bit and said Jody S, how do you do that? You just quoted the book I've been listening to. She looked at me like she didn't like what I had said. That was okay because I didn't like that she was passing this knowledge off as though it were her own or as though she knew these things from researching the topic. She just shrugged her shoulders and didn't say anything. I sat back down next to Matthew and then he started doing it. I jumped up and said basically the same thing to him. I was very upset that other people could remember this book verbatim.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-23),-0.106520556,-0.3072803,-0.14272015,0.22641304
290,"I was working as a dream therapist, consulting clients. In this building there was a lot of construction or it was being majorly remodeled. I was in this room that was going to be my office and sitting area. There were several people sitting there waiting to see me. It started out with just one and then all of a sudden there were five sitting there waiting for me. None of them had an appointment. I came out and was trying to take care of them. Shirley H was standing there also, but I'm not sure why. I had a sense that Matt O. was there but I don't recall seeing him. I spoke briefly with Shirley H and then went to the five people who were waiting for me. I'm really sorry there are so many of you waiting for me, but since none of you have appointments, let's see what each of you need and see how we can take care of each of you. Three of them had computer questions, based on things that they had heard me say before, that they thought I would be able to help them with. One of them was trying to install a program and but it told her she needed higher walls. Another one was trying to install a program, I think it was maybe like Anytime, but every time she got to one point her program would shut off. Since Shirley H was standing there I asked her if she was busy or in the middle of something. I told her that these three people had computer questions that I couldn't answer and thought she might be able to. She said she would be happy to talk to them. So I sent three of them to her. I then went to another of the women was there. She said she was there to talk to me about a client she had referred to me. Neither of us could remember the woman's name. So I went to my computer. I knew who she meant and what day she was in. So I went to my appointment book. Somehow my computer showed me the picture of these people, sitting in my waiting room. I was trying to go into the actual appointment book part to look up her name. I was having all kinds of problems with the computer. I somehow couldn't get the mouse where I needed it to be. Someone said something to me and I turned and looked over my right shoulder and there was another computer. Somehow I was trying to use my computer using the mouse from that other computer station behind me and too the right. I said, I don't know what my mouse is doing back here anyway. So I picked it up and brought it back to my computer. I was still having problems and I called Shirley H and asked if she could help. I thought, I know what I'll do. I'll just reboot. About that time Shirley H reached from behind me and unplugged it. I said no, no, no. She had already unplugged it and plugged it back in, so it restarted. It turned out to be fine and it just took a little bit longer. I finally found the woman and her name was Linda Coland [unknown in waking life] . I asked this other woman if that is the person she was there to talk to me about and she said yes. I went over and sat on a footstool in front of her. She was a thin woman dressed in black or burgundy. She had shorter length black hair and glasses. She was very thin. Maybe my age or a bit younger. I think maybe Shirley H sat down with me too. She was there to follow up with me regarding this person she had referred to me. She asked me how my session with her was and what the follow up was. I just told her that my session went fine and that I had referred her to Doctor Bl. This woman was very upset by that. I apologized and told her that I thought that was the best thing I could do for Linda. I helped her as much as I could in our session. I asked her why that bothered her. She said, well, I wish you had referred her back to me. Well, I didn't even know who referred her to me, let alone know that it was a psychotherapist that had referred her to me. So, she kind of shrugged her shoulders and left, I think. Actually, I think I did that before the other people showed up and that's when I found out three of them had computer questions. The person that was left was Linda Coland. Before I could get to her, she walking around looking at my shelves of books in my waiting area. One of the construction workers came up to and asked me if I wanted a partial wall or anything in my office. I said by all means. I said, what I would really like is a full wall with a door. So, I went and was standing and talking to this Linda Coland. She climbed down from something and walked under a ladder to me. She said, I'm doing very well. I'm doing much better. I said, I'm so happy to hear that. Let's go into my office and sit down and talk. So she went ahead in and by then they had already put in this wall and two doors. I though I would pull the doors shut which I tried to do. There were these white, looked like logs, in the way. I tried to move them out of the way with my foot but they were too heavy. So I bent over and moved them out of the way with my hands. I pulled the doors shut but they wouldn't meet. There was a six-inch gap. I said, Oh, look at that. That's such a shame. That's alright, we'll just leave them like that for now. I went in and sat down to talk with her.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-24),-0.08567032,-0.15905203,0.054436333,-0.10466821
292,"I was walking around outside. I was sitting on a stone ledge. Connie B and Susan J were there. I was talking to Connie B about the old house. She said there were so many people living in there with her right now. She was so frustrated. She said the families, and one maybe in particular, had a bunch of cats living with her in her room. One part of the dream I am with Paulette W, Joan Collins, and another woman. There is a man there too. Paulette W and this other woman and I are under the control of Joan Collins. I don't know why. We're so afraid of her that we will do whatever she tells us. She tells us that it's time to go have sex again. Something happens to interrupt us and the man and Joan Collins and the other woman walk away and I am talking to Paulette W. We're getting dressed and washing up and talking about how horrible this is and how much we don't want to do this. We decide to get dressed hurriedly and try to get out of there before she comes back so she can't find us. I'm not quite dressed and we here her coming. So I just grab my clothes and we take off running for the elevator. We realize that we don't have time to make it to the elevator so we run into a bathroom. We each go into a stall and close the door but we stand on the toilet so they can't see our feet. Someone, and I don't know if it is one of us or someone else, is actually going to the bathroom when they come in looking for us. They obviously don't see us because we are standing on the toilets and can't see our fit or anything. I am afraid that she may be able to see our heads above the top of the door so I am trying very hard to make sure she doesn't see any part of me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-25),-0.09254948,-0.2906684,0.10249037,-0.13332343
293,"I was in Las Vegas. I got to my room and dropped off my things. I put on my teal wool suit and headed down to the casino. I was walking through the casino when I saw Diane S and her dad. I stopped and said hello. We were both very surprised to see each other. I asked her why she was there and she said for fun and vacation. I told her I was there for work. We chatted a little bit about Vegas and told her that I had been there just a year or so ago. She said her and her mom love to go out to the beach. I told her that the last time I was there I only got outside for an hour the whole time I was there because I was there for a conference. I didn't know if I was going to have time for fun this time either. I told her it was nice chatting with her but I needed to meet my colleagues. As I was walking through the casino I was walking through all of these different rooms. In each room there was a group of people celebrating a certain college. Each room was a different college and it was parents and family of these college students. As I was going through one of them, someone handed me a cake and asked me to carry it to housekeeping for them. I don't know why I said yes, but I did. I carried it for a little while and finally ran into someone that worked there and told them what happened. She took it from me. So then I went on, I was going to go back to my room and realized that I had forgotten my room number again. I said, now, this is ridiculous. I have had enough dreams where I have forgotten my room number, that I should be very careful about that when I come to a hotel. So, I went up to the front and I stood in line and I was going to ask them what my room number was. I also thought I didn't have my room number with me so I though I was going to have to ask housekeeping to go up with me and let me in. Then I found my key in my pocket. Obviously it had my room number on it. So I went to the bank of elevators and I just barely caught one. She pointed out what floor numbers is what and I said yes, this is the right one. But then as soon as the door closed and we started to move I realized that it wasn't the right one. It was another of these elevators that move side-to-side instead of up and down. It kind of rolled on these tracks outside of the building. When it stopped I got off. I realized I was in the wrong place but there were no other elevators there for me to get to my room. I was on this thing kind of like a bus but it was just an employee and me. She didn't know how to tell me to get to the elevator that I needed. She finally called someone to come and meet me. As I was waiting there, these tons of people, like a convention. they were all together. I was feeling very uncomfortable in this crowd of people. So I kept moving different places to try to find a good place to stand. Now I think I was driving. And now it seems that I am alone. I was talking to someone on a walkie-talkie. They were trying to give me directions. I was trying to turn around and I pulled up behind this police car. As I did I realized it was a female police office and she was starting to back up. Unfortunately, she didn't see me in time. And then I backed up and turned around and got out and was waiting for this person. I heard someone yelling my name. And so, I got around to her and she took me to the elevator that I needed.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-28),-0.17005098,-0.18013963,0.095473506,-0.27525747
295,"I was at school, I think. I was sharing a bed with Father Nick and Bart H. Not intimately, just sleeping. Bart H slept in the middle. For some reason, one night they were in bed already and I tucked the sheets and blankets in all along my edge of the bed before getting in. I then was having a lot of difficulty getting under the blankets, while they just lay there and watched. Someone else came in the room and said something and then left. Later we were in the airport going home. Actually I think I was in my home airport but it didn't look like it, but several others that I was traveling with were there too, although they aren't from Indy. We were having trouble figuring out where we needed to go. All we kept seeing were restaurants and retail businesses. We went up some escalators and then back down. We finally found out that we needed to go to the ticket counter to get baggage claim tickets. We got in line. There were four of us. I was first in line. When it came my turn they all pushed their way in front of me. I was aggravated by that. At first the ticket counters were very high so you could barely see the people working behind them. When I finally did get to the counter I asked how that had happened and she didn't have an answer for me. While she was taking care of me a group of young girls clamored around the counter pushing me out of the way. Then I got upset again and said something. They felt I was getting upset for no reason but moved a little bit to allow me back to the counter. the counter was the height of a normal airline counter. I left the counter and headed for my car. Oddly I had just one small bag on a portable luggage carrier. I struggled a bit getting the carrier up the escalator. I was in a hurry so I was trying to walk up the escalator rather than just riding it up at it's own pace. I was following a man who was doing the same thing. It felt like someone behind me was watching me critically. It seems that there was more to this dream about steps and escalators but I don't remember the details. I went outside to find my car. It was dark and I couldn't remember where I parked. I wondered if I had written it down on something in my bag but for some reason I was stopping to look. I thought I was fortunate that it wasn't a big parking lot, so I just kept wandering around looking for my car. I encountered a man, maybe two men, in the parking lot who said something to me. just being friendly. The parking lot was on the slant of a hill and there was lots of dirt and grass around. The lot itself was gravel. I woke up before I found the car.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-29),-0.15691178,-0.1885106,0.18815087,0.17035538

His son was there too. I think I left came back. There were a lot of women there. It seems that they were all nuns, women from CIIS, and BJ. One or two of my CRHP sisters were there as I was going in. I had asked this one woman help me to learn how to use the Stairmaster. She wasn't sure how to use it but showed me. She fed this yarn into the Stairmaster because it would do some kind of knitting as you were using it. So she fed this in and it was feeding out this long piece of knitted yarn. It was very irregular and uneven and it came out very fast. I said well, it's very uneven and irregular. It doesn't really matter because it isn't something I want or need anyway. I was still having trouble using the machine. Then I was looking for someone else to teach me how to use it right. There were two machines there.

299,"I was sharing a bedroom and a bed, though not intimately, with Darren again. But we had not been intimate. We were trying to go to sleep. He kept rubbing up against me and I kept get irritated. He got upset. I said, Oh, Darren, I'm just PMS'ing. He rolled over and then he brushed up against me again. This time I got really upset and said Darren, will you please quit touching me? So he got mad and got out of bed and was pacing around. He was saying that this just couldn't keep going like this. I was noticing that the room was really a mess because he was so messy. I finally got out of bed and said, you're right. This can't keep going like this. I knew this wasn't going to work. We just need to end this. We are at some kind of family gathering with his family. We are looking through some pictures. I don't think we had told them yet that we were going to divorce again, or divorce, I don't' know. We were looking at pictures. There were some pictures with me in them. There were some other people there besides just his family. I found some pictures in there of Shirley J when she was a baby and I started pulling those out and showing them to Shirley J and kind of detracting people's attention I guess is what I was trying to do. I finally pulled out a couple of pictures of me. I guess we were supposed to be picking out a couple of pictures of me for some reason. I pulled a couple out finally and passed them around. There was one that a couple of people said they really liked and I just shook my head no. I said I just hate pictures of my self. They said oh, people usually do, but these are really good. Matt O. was there. I can't get back what he was doing there. Shirley J was asking if Darren and I were both at her house with her open windows if we would be able to keep an eye out for someone looking in. I said, Shirley J, that would be next to impossible with all the windows you have in that house. She said, yeah, she knew it would be pretty difficult and she probably needed to think about getting something to cover the windows. We talked about that a little bit. About how expensive that would be to cover all those windows. And She has so many patio doors in that house. I said one thing you could do that would be really inexpensive is what I did in my office. I just used a sheet. She looked at me quizzically. I said I just folded the sheet in half lengthwise and used thumbtacks and put it up there. She said that must have been a really long window. I said the sheet hangs behind the desk so you can't see how long the sheet is. Besides, that would be a really easy thing to hem up. I said, the other thing you could do is a rod pocket. She didn't know what I meant by that. So I went to one window where she did have a curtain hanging. I said, just like this. Just take the rod like this and feed it through one end of the sheet and just hanging it that way. I said it would be a little more expensive because you would need to buy curtain rods. And you would still need the sheets. But it would look a little better than hanging it with thumbtacks. When I was pointing to the rod there was no curtain on it, just the rod. And either Daddy or Bill F or someone did something at the other end and made the rod come loose and then it wouldn't go back right. They weren't helping me to get it back right so I was trying to do it myself. I finally got it back. Darren came up and did something. The next thing I know there is this table and the rod had come all apart and there were all of these screws and pieces and the rod had fallen apart. I was so aggravated that someone had done that. We were going to put it back together. I said, first we have to separate all these out by size so we know what goes where.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-10-03),-0.24049911,-0.13667907,-0.36744264,-0.16927646
300,"In the center of the mall they had these elaborate Christmas displays. This one woman went, inside one of them were her children. One of her daughters broke a ceramic doll and she was very upset and saying something like what did I do or what can I do. The next thing I knew the mother told her that she needed paint this line down the center of the mall to make up for what she did. She had this colored paint and a very thin artist brush. She was painting this very thin line down the center of the mall. I continued walking around trying to figure out where I needed to go to get to. I was looking for maybe the Van Maur store. I thought maybe that is where I needed to go to find my car. I kept walking back and forth trying to figure out how to get there. This man was out in the mall, working. I'm trying to remember what he was doing. I talked to him and I recognized his voice. He was talking into a microphone but talking to me at the same time. I finally said, oh, Jerry Curtis. He looked at me like I had it wrong. Then he said, Never and he told me his name. I said oh, you're on in the evening. I am so sorry. I listen to you all the time. He smiled at me and kept talking on his microphone. He shook my hand. I said I listen to you while I study. He kind of made this joking, funny face, like while you study? I finally made my way, well as I was trying to make my way to the parking garage I ran into some other people who were also headed for their car. They didn't know where they were parked either. We were talking about how we were supposed to find our cars around this mall and how this mall should do something to make it easier for people to remember where they parked and to find their car. I went outside and there was one couple and another woman. The one couple went out into the parking lot and came back. They were arguing. This other woman didn't have a clue where to begin to look for our cars. we are in kind of a tram. We're watching these kids play some kind of sport that I had never seen before. I asked someone what it was. They answered me but I didn't understand what they said. I was sitting in the second row with another woman and a couple of kids. The tram stopped so the kids could get out and get in the front row with their friends. We were watching this game. It was like there were two rows of deep ruts in the grass.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-10-04),-0.16079748,-0.030388366,0.10434062,-0.011457981
304,"I came into a store and both sides of the aisle were lined with fans. The shelves were full of fans. There was a teenage boy working there. I laid my purse down on one of the shelves and headed into the back room. Now it was a bakery. I think it started out as just me, but then it was two other women and me. We were climbing around on top of these huge piles of boxes. It didn't seem like boxes though because we weren't hurting them and in some places it was kind of soft like they were cushions. I don't know how to describe it. It didn't seem that we were climbing around on boxes of baked goods at this point. And we were up there because we were supposed to be to do our jobs. One employee came up to me with this basket of bath and shower products. She asked me if I had tried these different things. She pulled one out and was rubbing it into my arms. Then she pulled out another one and I said no again. I said why don't you try that one on my legs. Then she pulled out another one and asked me if I have tried it. I say no again. She put that one on my back. She straddled me to rub it into my back. There were some kind of metal things coming down from the ceiling. Something about murder. She kept trying different things and I kept saying no. And one hurt and I said, no, no. That hurt. Then we heard an alarm or something and they said, oh, it's time for the kids. They are supposed to be here at 6:00. We all started jumping down to the floor. Started dropping all these toys that were kind of like stuffed animals but not really. They were just really soft toys. So we're picking up the toys and tossing them to the children as they come in. After all the children were in we started playing with them. Now, all these toys had pull cords and would say different things. Most of them were animals now and looked like typical stuffed animals, like a polar bear. rhinoceros. They were all lying on their stomachs. When the store was still a bakery, we were sneaking pieces of pies and cake. We weren't supposed to take anything home with us. I dropped a partially eaten pie into an empty box. That was somebody else's. There were two or three different boxes or bags like that. I was going to sneak them out of the store. When I was doing that a manager came along and he was looking for something and I thought I was going to get caught. He moved the boxes and didn't see what was in them and then he moved them back into the trash pile. I picked them up and took them out with me. He saw me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-10-04),-0.28558952,-0.08900554,0.204501,-0.26465222
306,"I was on a TV show like Real People. I was hoping that for the next gig, I would get voted by the producers to go, because I knew that everyone would get to go. The men especially seemed to enjoy having me around. This place that we were staying was awesome. It was four floors and no elevators. But there is no way to describe it. So unusual. So awesome. I was cleaning up the kitchen and complaining because not enough people clean up the kitchen. The men came in and were all dressed up, they looked kind of like tuxes. Some of them had gold pants on. Some of them had black tuxedo pants. A couple of them weren't dressed yet and I went to get my camera so I could take a picture of them all dressed up. They told me I could take a picture afterwards. One of the men didn't have any pants. I went upstairs and I called down. the middle of the building was open from the first floor to the fourth. I called down and told him to come up. Several of them came up. They were laughing and telling me that it was just a joke and they were just teasing me. I got kind of mad at them but they apologized. We went back downstairs and they all took off and told me I could take a picture when they got back. When they got back they weren't dressed up anymore so I didn't get to take my picture anyway. There was one part of this house that was like a huge circular theater. It was so awesome. I can't possibly describe it and do it justice. The seats and decor was mostly red. Behind the last row of seats were all of these Christmas displays. It was soooo cool. There were many different alcoves with arched tops and lit inside and each one had a Christmas display. They wanted me to fix it all up and make it usable again so people would come in and use it again and appreciate it again. Some moving men came. There were these big things, taller than me, flat, magnetic, looked like toy soldiers maybe. These moving men came to pick all these things up and move them somewhere. I was helping them get these things loaded up on their truck. After they left there was quite a bit of extra space. Santa Claus and his wife came in and gave this to me. It was so incredible. They wanted me to fix it up. Mr. and Mrs. Claus and another couple were being lifted into the sky to heaven. It was like they had died but they didn't have to have the typical funeral and everything. They were just being lifted into heaven. Someone came up to me and I said they died and they didn't believe me. I told them what had happened and that this space had been given to me. We started rushing around looking at all the displays and looking at all the neat stuff. In one of the alcoves, Santa had told me he wanted me to set it up kind of like an electric train village. We were looking at all these things and talking about how to move these things around and display them. I was so excited I couldn't wait to get started. Then there was this huge old-fashioned pipe organ that I was playing. All the people I was living with were there. There was some kind of a concert or something going on. I read a poem that I wrote. There was a female singer. We had several women all dressed like her standing in different places and we would put the spotlight on them one at a time so it looked like she was magically moving from one place to the next. It was a soft green spotlight. At one point it was me. I was lying on my side on a couple of seats and I just kept rolling over and over. I rolled over some of the men. I was kissing some of them. Some of them were kind of hiding. They were all a lot younger than I was. I brushed my cheek against one of them and told him how soft his skin was. He seemed to really like that. One of them had part of his stomach showing from his shirt and I leaned down and kissed his stomach. I was being a little bit of a tease. Some of them got up and we were dancing. The music was out of control and there were tons of people in there. There was a bunch of black women. One of them was Audrey T. Another said you should have told us not to bring our purses in, and things like this. We finally got all of these people out and got some control back. When Santa first gave me this place I was showing some people around and we were looking at things. Before Santa had left he had pulled some things out of closets like a sleigh full of things and a rocking chair full of things and just different things like that. Some of the men had come back and were showing me their grades and saying that their grades were good enough that they were good choices to help me refurbish this place for having shows, and tours, and letting people see these wonderful Christmas displays.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-10-15),-0.19503388,-0.14496161,0.0044885175,-0.091849655
307,"Chris A Charging me $5500. Matthew doing drugs. Daddy asked Chris A what we owed him for towing my car to St. Joe. He said something jokingly and then with a look like I don't know how you are going to react to this he said $5500. He was totally serious. Daddy hesitated, shocked of course, and then said, well, if that's what we owe, then I'll take care of it. I was so upset. I went back to the house with Daddy. Mother was there. BJ was there too. I didn't let her know how upset I was. After she left, I tried to talk to Mother. I was so upset I couldn't speak. I tried but she could hardly hear the words. I told her what had happened. I said if I had known that I never would have had him tow it. That I wouldn't have paid that kind of money to do anything for that car. The car itself isn't even worth a fifth of that. I was so, so upset. Mother just sat and listened sympathetically. There wasn't much either of us could do. I told her that I tried to call Chris A and heard a message that BJ had left for him apologizing to him that Daddy had not offered to pay his gas money. This made me even more furious and I told Mother about that. I left and went to see Matthew at PLU. I walked. I found Matthew sitting, leaning back, on a cement step shaped sitting area. It was a kind of laid back, I don't care about anything I'm cool posture. I asked him how things were going. How classes were going. He said college is very cool but classes aren't going so well. I'm not sure how I got to this but he admitted to doing what he called the experimental drugs. I tried to stay calm and asked him which ones those were. He said sugar, marijuana, and something I didn't recognize. hadn't heard before. I was terribly upset. I crouched down in front of him and begged him not to do it again. I tried to remind him how dangerous it is. He continued with his casual carefree attitude. I asked him if Chris H did them too. He said no. I asked him what Chris H said about him doing them. He said Chris H asked him something like what the high is in it. As we were sitting there I saw Mother and Daddy drive by in a cute, blue convertible. I realized they must be test driving it for me. I pointed it out to Matthew but they were gone by the time he looked. A little bit later they drove by again, this time with the top up but it looked like a hard top now. I pointed them out quickly and he saw them this time. I said something about it being a cute little car. I was so distraught about the drugs that I got up and walked away. Matthew didn't say anything. I came past the campus again as I was walking home and say Mother and Daddy standing there talking to Matthew. At first I was going to walk on by but then decided to go join them. I didn't say anything to Matthew. Mother and Daddy were saying something about what a good young man Matthew is and something else. I wanted to say, this is not the grandson you knew. This is not the grandson that goes to church on Sundays, etc. But I didn't. I got very upset again and just walked away. Mother and Daddy followed me. I was in tears. Again, I couldn't speak. As we were walking away Matthew called out to me Mom, didn't you forget something. I kept walking because this was not the son I knew. Then I heard, Mommie. Mommie. My heart was breaking because of the drugs and because of walking away from my little boy as he called out to me like that. I didn't know what else to do. I fell to the ground in tears and put my hand to my mouth. Mother and Daddy asked me what was wrong. I couldn't speak. One of them finally said, He isn't doing drugs is he? I nodded my head yes. I woke up in tears. ",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-10-16),-0.3087689,-0.1611405,-0.14552088,0.11960717
308,"I was sitting in the yard at my birth home with classmates and a male physical education teacher. He was handing out report cards. I looked at mine and noticed that I was first in the class for grades for our football segment. I felt that was an extreme accomplishment. Partially because I hate football and partially because I don't know that I have ever been ranked first in my class for anything. Diane S said that she was second in the class. I didn't say anything to my classmates. I ran into the house where Bob F was in the living room watching TV. I showed him my report card. We were all sitting in the yard of my birth home. I was so excited that my hand was shaking as I pointed to the football ranking. He didn't say anything but simply pulled out his report card to show me that he had ranked first in several of his classes. I was very upset by this-that not only could he recognize and appreciate my accomplishment, but that it was just more of the same.

309,"I was in my apartment with Mother and some other members of my family that I cannot identify. It was not my waking life apartment. Something had happened that I realized this was a perfect opportunity to make some major furnishing changes in my apartment. I was going to switch the living room with the dining room for one thing. Currently in the dream home, the front door led directly into the dining room. Matthew had already hung curtains so I realized they were going to need to be switched as well. Matthew had arrived home from a visit with his Dad and the apartment was filled to capacity, little floor space left, with old furniture. I found out that Grandma and Grandpa Ho had intended to get rid of all this stuff and Matthew thought I might want some of it because of my interest in antiques and old furniture. So they sent it all with him, with the instructions for me to do whatever with the things I didn't want. There was a lot I didn't want and obviously didn't have room for all of it either. I still wanted to make the switch of the two rooms but now could not even find my original furnishings. At this point there were many other people there, most that I didn't know, and some were Harris family members. I believe BJ and Bev might have been there also. Everyone pitched in and began helping me to clear the place out by eliminating the items I didn't want. Now the apartment had a basement garage so we were taking these things through the stairwell into that space. Bob F was one of the men down there taking things from the people working upstairs. At some point I realized that a lot of the people who were helping were from a not-for-profit group and I was going to donate all of the things I didn't want to them. It almost felt as if things were multiplying because I kept finding more and more stuff that I hadn't realized was there before. There were several old sofas and big easy chairs. There were quite a few huge wood pieces, such as wall units, or bookshelf kind of things. Many of these were hideous looking in my opinion. They were very large, heavy and difficult to move. We were alternating our positions and jobs in clearing the place out. Some people wanted turns being at the top of the stairs. I mostly stood between the various rooms and the top of the stairs and kept pushing things toward the person at the top of the stairs. I would occasionally put things into the stair well myself. Sometimes just sitting things on the first landing and sometimes handing things down to men in the basement/garage. The stairwell had a few steps to the first landing, then turned left and went the rest of the way down. I had taken something with two legs that I thought was very light and not dangerous and just kind of pushed it down. I realized after I let go that one of the legs hit someone in the head. Instead of saying anything I walked away. As I did so I knew I should go back and acknowledge what I did and apologize but I was too embarrassed and for some reason afraid to. Then I heard people talking loudly and criticizing what had happened. The man was bleeding but I don't know how badly. Someone thought he might need stitches but most thought that person was overreacting. I never did go and admit what I had done. This was taking much longer than people had thought it would. Many of us were beginning to get hungry. I went and asked Daddy if I should order dinner to be delivered. I don't remember him answering me then but I didn't do it. At the time I thought I didn't need his permission to do that if I'm going to pay for it myself. Maybe I thought if I asked him he would offer to pay. In waking life I know he would. For whatever reason we didn't order dinner and we kept working. The Harris family members that were there had been there for another reason and had not expected to stay so long. Even when they decided to stay and help with this new situation they didn't realize it would take so long. I don't think any of us did. They were particularly hungry. I kept thinking about how Darren and Matthew got all of this stuff here and how I could have been unaware of them bringing all of this stuff into the apartment when it had to have taken them a good deal of time. BJ and Bev kept identifying items that they thought I would want to keep. One of them found a beautiful bedroom suit. It was white with a pastel flower design/fabric on parts of it. I said that I absolutely wanted to keep that. In waking life I have wanted a new bedroom suit for almost 20 years, but can never seem to afford it. They and we found quite a few really great furniture items, artwork, two really great desks. one that I would keep in the kitchen and one for my office, other decorative items. Some of the artwork seemed very contemporary and colorful. In fact, there was an artist there painting a piece similar to several that were already there. I felt bad that he saw me deciding to give them away. I kind of liked them but not enough to keep them in light of everything I had there. At some point the scene shifted and we were still in the same apartment but it now seemed as though we were clearing out the remnants of someone who used to live there for us to move in. There were things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. Some things I would decide to keep and either not remove or rehang after thinking about it. In the kitchen there were cabinets full of white/see-through plastic containers and I gave away the containers and everything. There were also quite a few small wooden cabinets for lack of a better word, that had lots of little compartments and such. They were each made to house certain types of items. I had removed one from the wall, examined it carefully, and then replaced it deciding to keep it. I then decided to keep all of the similar ones. There were also two or more refrigerators. They had containers in them but no food. I gave away all but one of them, containers and all. The one I kept seemed to fit nicely into a kitchen cove. It was smaller than a conventional home refrigerator and it was brown. As we continued to clear things out I decided to put all of the artwork in one place together and I would not go through it until after I had the furniture I wanted and placed where I wanted it. Then I could better decide which artwork I wanted to keep and had the space to hang. There was a lot of artwork and I really liked most of it. We continued to try to find the living room and dining room pieces that I wanted to keep and get them placed where I wanted them. I wanted to gather the pieces into the appropriate room and then have Mother help me decided where to place things for the best aesthetic results. For some reason I was focusing on completing the dining room first, but was definitely focused on the living room second. we thought we were almost done and then realized that my bedroom was still full so we began working on it. Then we thought we were almost done and we realized the kitchen was still full. In working on emptying the kitchen I noticed all of the things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. I removed some of them but asked others to help with that. I went into the bedroom and began selectively taking things off the walls. I kept the religious items that were there and some of the lighting fixtures/lamps. The only thing in particular that I remember hanging in the kitchen, though I remember there were a lot of things hanging, is a small yarn thing that reminded me of a miniature flower holder that was popular maybe twenty years ago. People were beginning to complain more and more about how hungry they were. I finally decided to go ahead and order pizza. One man pulled a bunch of pizza coupons out of his pocket. They offered two medium pizzas for $9.99. I asked someone to call in an order and just order a variety of different kinds. There were a lot of people there so they needed to figure out how many to order. There were a lot of wicker decorative items. Some of them were basket like in nature and I would put things from the walls in them. Some of the huge wood wall units still had many items sitting on the shelves. We were moving them with the things still in place. I have no idea how those things did not fall off. I was always glad when I could push a piece onto an area rug and move it along with no problem. Some of the things were oddly shaped and we had to figure out how to get them down the L-shaped stairwell. Some were extremely heavy. Some that I thought would be really heavy I would see one or two men hoist above their heads and carry them out. Some large items were so light I could lift them with one hand and push them down the stairs myself, even some of the large, stuffed chairs.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-10-16),-0.14068799,-0.108104266,0.13406254,-0.1930128
310,"He kind of made a pass at me. Then he took me to his bedroom but there were a lot of other people in there. The bedroom was very contemporary. It had many spaces with partitions. Everything has these very curvy lines to it. I don't know how to explain this at all. He chased all the people out. I realized there were more people in there still. He was trying to get them all out. When he did, we realized his wife was there and she was unpacking and talking to him like nothing was going on. She didn't see me there. I tried to sneak out and she saw me. I ran out the door. Instead of running down the two flights of stairs, I simply jumped over the rail and landed down two flights.

316,"I'm driving and now I have someone in the car with me. We're trying to get back home. We don't remember the way. It seems as though we are in Norton. We take a couple of turns hoping that we are headed in the right direction. Finally there is a very large African-American woman working on the front door of her house. She had her back to us. I finally decided to pull up anyway and asked her for directions. I just stopped on the road and she turned around. I asked and she gave me directions. She said, well, you're headed in the wrong direction to go to Indy. You need to go back the other way and go to that road and turn right? I didn't know what road she meant. She had turned back around and went back to her work on the door. We were going to turn around and head back, even though we still weren't sure of the directions. For some reason we stopped somewhere and we went inside. Maybe for something to drink. People are looking at us kind of strangely. We asked for directions again and someone points to a pile of papers, like glossy photos, sitting on a table. She said, your answer is in there. So we rushed over there and began going through them. We were lifting them up and laying them down as you would if you wanted to keep them in the right order. They were pictures of movie stars. The person with me knew all their names and she was really good at naming them very quickly. When we got to the bottom it was a wedding. I looked at it and realized it was this friend that was with me. I said look at this. Suddenly we noticed what she was wearing. She was wearing a wedding dress. We finally realized that she had run out of her wedding. So we were walking around this building. There were many rooms. Each one had an altar and a lot of them were decorated similarly. like there might have been a few basic themes that they used. One of them was like a flower arrangement sitting on some goblets and there was water flowing, kind of like a table top water fountain. I finally said, we have got to go. We have got to get out of here. We finally found this one room and there were people that we knew in there and people that knew she had run away and left her fiance at the altar. We were talking about how hungry we were. This one woman came up who had baked the cake. She was so sad and distraught because no one was going to enjoy her cake. She had made some other cakes for dessert as well. For some reason she said we could taste them as long as we didn't cut into them. Like we could taste, we should take some of the decorations off the top to taste. I asked her where the wedding cake was and told her I really wanted to see it. She took us to see it. It was three squares like Mother and Daddy's. She said, but don't touch the wedding cake. So, a couple of us lifted icing decorations off these smaller cakes and were eating those. Someone took them off the wedding cake also and was eating those. Then I realized that someone had actually cut into the cakes. We were picking up pieces of those cakes and eating them. Some of them were ice cream cakes. The fiance didn't seem to be very upset when he saw this. He was crouched down next to another woman at a table and talking to her. I with this friend of mine, who was the bride-to-be, to talk to them a bit. He didn't seem to be upset with her or anything. I told my friend that I thought he was attractive and asked her if she would mind if I went out with him. She said, no, that was fine but that I would have to wait because it would be improper for me to approach him right away. As we were walking away I commented on how nice he was and she agreed. We were both surprised that he was handling this so well.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-10-26),-0.18314391,-0.1202495,0.23417051,0.11981397
318,"I get the feeling that I was at my birth home but the people there were people from CIIS and from the sleep center. We got word that this famous shoe designer was going to be there and was going to give us each a pair of shoes. When it was almost time for us to go in this room where she set up there was a lot of. Someone said there was no line so everyone was just kind of milling around. Then a couple of people started to form a line, so I got in that line quickly. A couple more people followed and so on. Someone else started another line so I moved over to that line and everyone followed. When they opened the door and let us in. At first they just let a couple of people in so I was one of those first few to go in. At first I thought there were just a couple of styles and all in white. I never wear white shoes. Then I realized the whole room was almost wall to wall shoes and several shelves high, different colors. White, pink, beige, navy, and black. There were some that had multi-colored gemstones and flowers and looked very gaudy to me. I couldn't decide and I was going around and around and around in this room. I suddenly realized that everyone else had chosen theirs and I still had not. While I was in there, Gill U came in. I wondered what he was doing there. I thought, why won't he leave me alone. I said hello and asked him what he was doing there. I told him this was a special event just for our company employees. He kind of blew it off a little bit and continued walking around. He said something but I don't remember what. Then he left. I noticed Doctor W and his wife were there. I didn't say anything to them. I pretended not to see them there. They didn't say anything to me so I don't know if they were doing the same thing or if they really didn't see me. Julie S came up to me. I was looking at one pair in particular. She said I see that you have the same taste in shoes as I do. I said, yes I do. As it was winding up the designer was there and said something to me. I told her what I was looking for but that I hadn't found it in my size. There was one style, pink and flat heels, that was called the president or presidential. I just noticed a couple more boxes of those that I hadn't seen previously so I quickly looked to see if my size was there, but it wasn't. So her and her employees were starting to pack up. I kept walking around the room and there were these other things that she had made and were hanging from peg hooks. Some of them were dream catchers. Someone said something about the dreamcatchers. I agreed that they were beautiful and told them that I do dreamwork. They said, really, you interpret dreams? I said, I help people interpret dreams. I said, I have a collection of dreamcatchers on my office wall at home. Some of the things hanging from the peg hooks I don't know what they were and am at a loss to even describe them. maybe similar to necklaces but I don't think that's what they were. We were sitting back in the living room. Karen M was sitting there and wanted to see what shoes I had chosen, but I didn't get any. I had come out with some things in my arms though. They must have been scarves. The designer had given me those in place of shoes. I told Karen M I didn't get any shoes and asked her what she got. She was showing me the things that she got.

This couple decided that they really needed a vacation so they decided to take off and I think they were just going out to do something fun for the day. It was as though there were two of the wife. It wasn't two separate women but two of the same woman. They went and got into their little toy car and were going to leave. Now just one of the wives was in the car. They were having trouble getting out of their garage. I helped them somehow. It was as if I was playing with toys because I bent over and reached down and helped them. Some of the neighbors came out after them. They were angry with them. They drove their car up a set of stairs. They were running back into their apartment to get away from someone. Now real people were inside an apartment. There were two people sitting in old-fashioned bathtubs full of water. One really large man came in. He is one that they had been trying to get away from. He had nothing on but shorts/boxers/swimming trunks. I came up behind him and grabbed his ankles and made him fall head first into one of the tubs. The person sitting in the tub held the man's head beneath the water until he drowned.,elizabeth.tsv,(2001-11-06),-0.21665782,-0.18944542,0.045293357,0.047880743
325,I went for a walk with Amy S and someone else on the Main trail. We were walking to a bank. Amy had an interview and when we came back we came to this cornfield that had a maze cut in it. We were discussing whether or not to cut through the fields through the maze or to go the way we know. I said it was so close to dark that I was concerned that we would not be able to find our way in the dark. They finally agreed and we cut straight across the way we had come. We ran into Barb M. We are standing and talking to her only now it seems just me. I asked her if she had ever been on the Main trail and she said no. She is standing with me and looking at a bunch of necklaces. I don't know where they are coming from. I think we are outside. It looks like various. I'm not sure how to describe them. Two of them were very long colored beads. Barb had never been on the Main and didn't even know where it was. I told her I would take her and add a little heart to her day. I did. We got separated. I don't know if she got lost or not. I see her in her car and she is headed back to CI but she is driving on the Main. I waved to her to come back and she does. We tell her that she can't drive on the Main that it is for pedestrians and bicyclists only. I am at Brad S and Amy's house for dinner. We are talking. Amy had invited Darren and Matthew and this other man. This other man wasn't there with his wife. We talked and had a good time. Of course I stayed away from Darren. I went and found Marshall E and I went and found Amy and asked her what was going on. why she had invited Darren. I don't remember her answer. I tried to resolve to be as pleasant as possible. I had talked a little bit to this other man that she had invited. He wanted to know what I was doing. I said basically nothing except being a full-time student because I was too embarrassed to talk about my part-time jobs when I am working on a Ph.D. We sat down to have dinner and this other man is playing with my foot under the table. I got Amy by herself and asked her what was going on. Somehow I knew this man was married but I don't remember now how. She said that yes he is married but that he only sees Shannon on weekends and I don't know how that is going anyway. I said but I don't want to be the reason anyone's marriage breaks up. I said I could not live with that.,elizabeth.tsv,(2001-11-07),-0.19722481,-0.18655054,0.12914819,-0.086854145
327,"I was on my go-cart/bicycle/car. I will call it my car from here because that is what I was calling it in the dream. I was going to St. Joe. I picked up several of my relatives on the Harris side of the family. Allen was one of them but I don't remember who the others were. They got on behind me like they were one behind the other as if on a motorcycle. We were going for a drive but I don't remember where we were headed. I was going up a hill and I was having difficulty getting up the hill. Uncle H used his feet to help us get up this hill. I am sitting in Doctor Da' office. Mother and Daddy were there with me. I had an 8 am appointment. Doctor Da is a dentist. We sat there. We kept waiting and waiting all day long until almost 4 pm. I finally asked while we were still waiting and he said that he didn't show that we had an appointment. I said I had just made the appointment two months ago and that I had made it for first thing in the morning so the rest of the day I could have free. I was upset because I had now lost the whole day. He didn't even apologize. He just said that I didn't have an appointment and it wasn't in his books. He didn't have anything computerized. He just had a paper appointment book. I thought it might be the receptionist fault. that perhaps she didn't write it down in the book when we spoke. He asked me if I had a specific problem and I said that I did. I've had this tooth that I lost a filling and it's been bothering me for a long time. He said I could schedule another appointment. When I scheduled the last time the soonest I could get in was two months later and now I was going to have to wait another two months. I was very upset because Mother and Daddy thought that I had screwed up. They thought that maybe I had written it down wrong. Then there was some discussion about my taking the relatives for a ride in my car and how inappropriate that was. Matthew was with us and so was Bill F. Someone from Doctor Da' office had borrowed some audio books or videos. First it was just one and she brought it out and gave it back to me, but later she came back with 3 or 4 more. I noticed that they were all still in their cellophane wrappers which meant they had not even watched them or listened to them. They were still brand new. I finally decided to go ahead and leave. I had some other things too. Bill F was driving a pick-up truck so I put my things in the back of the truck and told Bill F to go ahead and take Matthew back and I would just go ahead and drive my car back MYSELF. No one HAS to ride with ME.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-11-24),-0.20456558,-0.21454124,-0.07194766,0.0995385
328,"Shortly after connecting with this man and after a phone conversation with Matthew I said I really needed to get more serious about joining the YMCA, knowing how much better I'll feel after I do. I just got done talking on the phone with Matthew and after I finished talking on the phone with this man I immediately drove to PLU to see Matthew. He was having some problems with his skin. He had this red blotchy. something. all over his skin. He was somewhat successful cooling it with some hand lotion he found at the YMCA. I did kind of the same thing as soon as I heard what they were saying. I went and took a hot shower and felt so much better instead of the lotion. But I noticed in a mirror that it was all red splotches, like hives. We discussed calling an ambulance but for whatever reason we didn't. And then, uh, first thing I. is when some of them did and the next day was Christmas.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-11-25),-0.20622547,-0.024335455,-0.21549292,-0.059112575
330,"I was in the city where I live. I stopped by Petsmart to buy something to send to ground zero for the dogs there. It was $2.33. Petsmart said they collect things that people want to send there and that they send the shipments every few days. I could just pay for it and they would ship it. When she rang up the sale she didn't take my money. She said, no, we'll take care of it. Yet, she had rung it up on the register and she left the register open. I gave it to her and I left. For some reason I went back in and some woman was talking about something that happened to her and she said something about the Grace of God. I said, I think everyone has a little bit of the Grace of God in them. I was talking to her and one other woman then I realized that one of the store managers had overheard me. I went ahead and was pushing a cart for someone reason. I turned the cart around in a very tight space and I had two things in my arms, like a binder and a pair of shoes and something else. Odd for being a pet store. But they were my things. I put the cart back and went outside. It was raining a little bit and I rushed to get in my car. It was dark then. I am trying to get out of this parking lot and it is no longer raining and no longer dark. There are all these chain link fences. high. and they are kind of like a maze and I am having trouble getting out. I don't even remember how I got in through this. There were a couple of places that I thought I could get out but I was afraid to try because it was such a narrow opening. This one place I tried. It was at an angle but I caught the car on a wire or something as I went through and it snapped. I was worried that I had damaged the car. As soon as I went through I realized I couldn't get out from there so I had to go back the way I came. I had to really, really maneuver the car around so I could get it at the right angle so I could get through and I was worried about getting caught on that wire again. I did get through but there were like two or three wires. One was stuck to the front of the car but it kept stretching as I went through and it finally snapped around. Again I was afraid I had damaged the car. Then I realized that someone had parked their car previously and now it was gone so that gave me an opening to get out. So I went out this way. Then the pavement was almost like these really large cement. rough. rocks. It was really rough driving on them. I thought if I damage my car Daddy is going to think I was careless and I will need to reassure him that I have been trying to be very careful. That I've learned to be very careful not to damage my car by being careless. I finally got to a smooth road and I was trying to figure out how to get back home from where I was. I was on W. 56th St. I realized I had to go up this hill and now, instead of my regular car that I have in waking life, I know I was driving a VW bug but it was without the shell and a one-person vehicle. It was almost like, at least partially, it went under my own power. Maybe bicycle pedals. I had to go up this hill. I was having trouble getting up the hill. getting enough speed or power. I was talking to someone else or someone was commenting on it was a VW bug. I don't know. This part is very sketchy and makes absolutely no sense to me. It's like I'm still traveling through the streets. I had to go through part of downtown Indy. At the same time as I am going through downtown, it is as though someone is interviewing this small group of people. Three of them were male dressed in black for lack of a better word I will call them vigilantes but they were men who tried to fight crime in our city. They were talking about what they would have done and how they would have been prepared. I thought they were talking about the 911 attack. They said they would have known ahead of time and they would have been on walkie-talkies and would have cut the kids off at the pass and warned the teacher, etc. I am driving along the street and the one man is talking to a woman, girlfriend maybe, in his group, by cell phone. She is sitting on a step outside the building, saying I told you that you could leave me out of it and you said no you wanted me in it and now you're telling me that you don't need me. She was just a little perturbed. She wasn't really mad at him. Just a little perturbed by it. I'm finding at this point I need to grab the edge of the buildings and pull myself to keep myself moving forward.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-11-25),-0.28868207,-0.03162221,0.27797368,-0.09530176
332,"Kendall B came to visit but we were once again at my birth home. Mother and Daddy were there. He was very out-going. Shortly after he arrived he took all of his clothes off because he liked to be naked around the house. We were going to sit and talk about my dissertation but we kept getting interrupted. There were a lot of people around and a lot of commotion. I finally asked him if he would mind going downstairs to sit and talk. He said that was fine with him. We went through the kitchen and he opened up some of the kitchen cabinets looking for something sweet to eat. He found a couple of chocolate chip cookies and grabbed those on the way down. We went downstairs and there were people down there too. I think Bev and I'm not sure who else. So we were being distracted there too. I kept having difficulty getting other people to leave us along so we could actually have a discussion. I think I went back upstairs once or twice looking for more of my notes or materials. I did convince him to put some clothes on because it was making my parents uncomfortable. It started out that he just flew in for the day and then he was going to fly back out that night. But with all the people and commotion I was concerned that we weren't going to be finished in time. He said that really wasn't a problem at all. He ended up going to spend the night in a hotel I think. I just had this image of opening this hotel room and it was. you could barely open the door, like something was sitting behind it. So I was trying to open the door far enough to somehow push that out of the way so I could open the door all the way. I also remember those doorways were very low and Kendall B was going to have to bend over to come down this hall and get in the door to his hotel room. Something about two of his children.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-11-27),-0.29543105,-0.14685749,-0.19053933,-0.009466839
334,"They started fighting over me. They were in a sailboat race together. It was very exciting for them and they won. Afterwards they were totally exhausted and cold. I was sitting in a chair and holding one on each side of me trying to help them warm up and letting them rest and getting their rest back. I don't know what happened from there. I got up to leave and their father, Eddie Arnold, came out of his bedroom. I saw five other men in there with him. A couple of them saw me and kind of made a pass at me. His first wife had died. The younger sister was feeling very lonely and wanted attention. I soon realized that's what both girls wanted. They just wanted all the attention and they didn't give any attention back. The girls had a younger brother and they wanted me to help them keep him out of the room. There were two doors that he could get into and they were side by side. I was trying to hold both doors closed against his efforts. I was trying to find something within my reach that I could block the door with, like a doorstop. I couldn't find anything. The younger sister, I think her name was Sandy [unknown in waking life] , kept handing me things. She didn't understand what I was looking for and kept handing me things that weren't going to work. Then I saw that the older sister had a collection of things on the wall and a couple of them were doorstops. One of them had a teddy bear face with little foam pieces that were the facial features. They were on the part that you would stick under the door. So I took the ears and stuff off so I could put it under the door. I knew I could glue them back on when I was done with it. I put it under the door but then it morphed and was no longer a doorstop so it didn't work. I had torn it apart for nothing. I suggested newspaper but that didn't work because he just pulled it right through the door. I tried various things and I ended up having to just sit there and hold the door closed as the girls had wished. I'm thinking the older girl's name was Sharon. Sharon had morphed and was now very small. Her legs had become the size of a Barbie doll. I treated Sandy like a little sister. She had these things out in the hall that were making a lot of noise. I was concerned about bothering the neighbors and convinced her to bring them in. Actually at this point she morphed into a young child. Then I heard someone else in the hallway that was making just as much if not more noise. I asked her what that was and she told me. I told her that was going to have to come in too. She got very sad so I asked her to explain to me what it was. She had these metal pails with water in them and something attached to them that was making all the noise. She would set the water in the hallway on the heat vents. She said that it helped return more water to the land. I asked her if it would work if we took the noisy part off. I said if we just set the pails on the heat vents the water will still return to the land. So that satisfied her and we did that. I went back out in the hall a couple minutes later and the maintenance man was out there. He was upset because the water was sitting there. I explained to him with her standing there what it was for. He really softened and became kind and said that was fine and we could leave them there. Everyone was happy now and we went back into the apartment. I guess sometime along here I had let the little boy back in and he was in his bedroom. I went in and talked to him a little bit and patched things up and made our relationship okay. I was commenting to Sharon on how nice it was to be sleeping with all these people. She looked at me funny and I laughed and I said I just meant having so many family members and loved ones in the house and around you. I said it's just a really nice feeling. She just smiled at me. Then I heard her dad come in and go in his room. I said that I needed to go talk to him for a couple of minutes. I went into his room and that's when he came on to me. At first I tried to resist and then I gave in a little bit. Then I tried to resist again and back and forth. I could see from the light under the doorway that Sharon was pacing back and forth on the other side of the door. Probably wondering what was going on. He had a tub of water sitting by his bed so I asked him to give me a foot massage and that would be my excuse as to why I was in there so long. He soaked my feet in a tub and rubbed them. He was very attentive. It was very nice. One of the girls opened the door and saw us and got really upset. This is odd as I have it recorded twice. The other part of the recording said I used this excuse with Sharon and she was fine with it. They lived in an apartment building as I did. They lived a couple floors above me I think. I tried to go back to my own apartment but I didn't have my key with me and I couldn't remember my apartment number.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-11-27),-0.15624264,-0.23318464,0.0025976724,0.056219738
335,"I was moving into Grandma F's old house. I'm not sure why I was moving in there. I don't recall actually moving my things in. I had come down the gravel driveway and I was hearing a lot of noise and thought it was my car. Then I realized that there was a car behind me. It was as though I was spinning in the gravel and couldn't move forward. I finally got it off into the grass and then I realized the noise was coming from the car behind me. They went ahead forward and backed into one of the buildings. There was a man in there working on cars. It was where the chicken house used to be. Maybe it was the chicken house. I thought it was incredible that they were able to get there car backed into the small opening of the building without any problem at all because they didn't seem to have control of the car, the accelerator or the brakes. I don't know if that man ended up being able to help them or not. It seems that he couldn't. They left. It was two black men in a car and I don't know how often St. Joe sees black people. Aunt M came back and showed me the different keys for each of the doors and how to get in. There was a big gap in the doors when you closed them. I was concerned about that for the winter as far as keeping it warm and how much extra it would cost to heat. Especially since I don't like a cold house at all. She talked about what it would take to fix it but she didn't actually say she would get it fixed. I don't know what that was about. Mother was back there. We talked about the people who had lived there before and what had happened to them and them moving out. The brother of one of those women was looking for them and didn't realize they had moved out and was talking about that a little bit. Then I guess he just left. I don't know. Mother and I went into one part of the house. It's not familiar to me. It's around the furnace. We found a bunch of boxes. I looked in one of the boxes and there was a bunch of canning lids and I started to pull those out for mother and then I realized there was other stuff in there. I ended up looking in all the boxes. I found some white and colored gauze. I found a really valuable book on dreams written by Carl Jung and it was in mint condition. I was so excited I was in tears. I was really surprised to find it. that grandma had such a book and that it was in such good condition and that I had found it. For some reason one of the women who used to live there was there now. She had some kind of injury and needed some gauze and first aid tape. I didn't want to give her all the ones that were pretty colors cause I was going to save that and use it as ribbon. I gave her some of the white. As the dream continued she wasn't there anymore. When I took all this stuff in the house and put it away and drug all the empty boxes out into the trash pile, which was in the center of the circular driveway by the barn. I realized I hadn't had lunch and was getting a headache. I found myself a snack bar and ate that. We kept working. That didn't really do the trick so I went down and fixed myself a bowl of soup. We were going through kitchen cabinets. I found some things that the other women had left and was throwing away things that I wouldn't use like baby formula. I sat down and was eating my soup. I'm not sure how to explain this. I felt we were sitting inside yet at the same time it felt like outside as it was a picnic table and there was a lot of greenery and hay and cobwebs at the one end of the table. This stuff was going in my soup. I was picking it out and getting disgusted by it. I started moving all this stuff away from the end of the table. All these family members were now. Bob F and his family were there. BJ, Mike A and family were there. Nicholas F climbed up to the table and grabbed my soup. I said, hey bud how about if I fix you a bowl of your own. He said okay and I started looking for a small bowl for him. While I was doing that Mike A started telling a story. He stopped and somebody said that he didn't think I was listening. I said, I'm listening I'm just looking for a bowl for Nicholas F while I'm listening. I don't know if he ever continued his story or not. I got Nicholas F some soup and then I started going back through the cabinets again. I said, ah here is the important stuff, the pasta! We talked a little bit about my spaghetti container here at home and how I always keep it full and that spaghetti is my primary comfort food. I was telling everyone about the dream book I found and how excited I was about that. Mother and I were outside. I realized that I needed to take a broom and sweep off the outside windows and walls because they were full of cobwebs and dirt and stuff. I went back inside and. this is really strange. It is as though I was sitting inside and mother was sitting outside and I wanted to raise the shades. They were the old-fashioned roll shades. I lifted up the screen and realized I still couldn't' get to it so I asked mother to raise the shade. Then I thought that was really odd and that I would have to go outside every time I wanted to raise or lower a shade. My soup was full of grass, and dirt and cobwebs. I asked mother where the compost pile was. She showed me and I went out and got rid of the rest of my soup. It was vegetable soup. I was pushing all of this greenery stuff away from the table so that wouldn't happen anymore. I told the others that they could come and visit now but that was part of my apprehension about moving in there - that people would be dropping any and all the time. I wasn't sure I was ready for that. It is one of the things I appreciated about living further away.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-11-27),-0.12985665,-0.16182023,0.1941789,0.31852072
336,"We went to visit a friend or someone I know that lives in the country. He has 22 acres of land and he was going to be on the news with his tractor and with a cow or a dog. He does these tricks with this animal and his tractor. I can't really explain what the tricks were even though I can visualize one of them a bit. There was some comment about how good the food was there and about it being out in the country and being an hour away from something but I don't know what. I was asleep in one of the bedrooms and someone came in and crawled in bed with me and I couldn't wake up. I thought that it was really happening and I couldn't wake up and I was feeling for the person. I thought maybe it was Nick R. I kept saying, Nick R, is that you? But he wouldn't answer. Finally, the dog went in and started attacking this person and chased him away. It turns out it wasn't Nick R. The dog was kind of shaking me. I was finally able to wake up then. There was something else about this dog but I can't remember what now. I closed the bedroom door then and stuck something under the door. The dog grabbed it and drug it outside and was attacking it. It was just sitting there tapping his paw against the floor and guarding this thing. I guess because it still had the scent of this man. I finally got up and went out and said good dog and then said something else to him so he knew he didn't have to stand guard anymore. It was a collie. There was another little dog, like the one on the Taco Bell commercials, came in too and I picked him up and took him inside and let him run up the steps.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-11-29),-0.06811935,-0.26905537,-0.032317057,0.22355878

Doctor Pa planned for the surgery and some options. I wanted to be sure what they were talking about. I said I would like to get it all done today and someone said, ok. Well, then that's what we'll do. I still didn't know what that meant. The five of us were going to drive to the hospital together.

339,I was working for BCC. Our desks were right next to each other as they were in waking life when I worked there. The daughter of the boss was working right next to me. She was younger and turned the radio up really loud. I don't remember what kind of music it was or if that bothered me also or if it was just the volume. I asked her to turn it down and she refused. I reached over and turned it down myself and told her it was difficult to hear on the phone with the music so loud. She just reached out and turned it back up. I reached down and turned it down again. She turned it back up. The boss came up and told me to just let it go so I quit. I was just working there part-time. I remember I was packing up all of my personal things in plastic grocery bags and I was surprised at how much I had. I had two of them full of nothing but candles. all different colors and sizes. The boss had left. It wasn't that I was present but I knew that he was talking to someone about my leaving and concerned about it. He didn't want me to leave.

340,"Matthew and I were on our way to St. Joe and we stopped on the rode and picked up Bob A. He was back in my home state to visit his family. He is a career army officer and lives in Texas I believe. We stopped and picked him up and agreed to take him home before we went to see my parents. He and I were both giving Matthew directions while he and I both chatted. his parents did not live where they do/did in waking life. He directed Matthew to some back roads. I told him I didn't remember his parents living back there or moving back there. We got to his house and four of his brothers came out. In waking life they were not his brothers but Don Sc and three of his brothers. I commented to Bob A that he and his brothers haven't changed a bit in 25 years, that they all looked exactly like they did when I graduated from high school. I was looking at their height and such. I was amazed that they still looked the same. They hadn't seemed to age at all, height, weight, etc. After we got there we find out that Daddy had wanted to borrow their tractor. I think Bill F was there already but I don't know if he had a car back there or if someone took him there and was waiting for us to take the tractor back to the house. We ended up with three vehicles though. We had my car, a truck, and the tractor. Matthew drove the truck. I drove the car. Bill F drove the tractor. The Sc boys came out to do something to the truck or the tractor. We're getting ready to take the vehicles and tractor back to daddy but now it is Uncle H and Aunt R's house. We're in their garage and there is stuff piled everywhere, wall-to-wall and 5 or 6 feet high. Uncle H is cleaning things out and getting ready to get rid of a lot of stuff. Aunt R is in very good health. Her and I were talking about doing this cleaning. I said, yes, in the last few weeks I've been cleaning a lot of closets and drawers in my own home. It feels so good having done that. Getting rid of stuff that I never use or look at. that just sits there. We were looking for some paper towels because there was oil all over the seat of the tractor. Uncle H and Aunt R were being very frugal. They had the select-a-size paper towels and they would give us the smallest possible each time and it wasn't enough to wipe up the oil. I had a sense at one point when I grabbed two additional ones that they were making some kind of comment about how many of these towels we were using. One of us had done something to spill some water on a worktable or something and we used paper towels to clean it up. We tried to clean it up before they noticed but Uncle H saw us. He said not to worry about it, that he does it all the time. He helped us clean it up. I also get the sense that maybe we were putting a lot of this stuff they were getting rid of in this truck that Matthew was going to drive. I took some little stuffed animals or animal toys of some kind, like you would get in a kids meal - and moving them from one spot to another. By the time we got ready to leave the garage had much less stuff in it. Aunt P was there as well. I just saw her once when we were getting ready to leave. I approached her and thanked her for the money she recently sent me and told her how much I appreciated it. She just asked me again to keep it a secret between us. There was some discussion or confusion about who was driving what.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-12-08),-0.22116143,-0.106035724,-0.2347371,0.2281125
343,"I was on this, I don't know what, and Nick R came back. He told me that he never takes me with him because I wouldn't fit in with his rich and famous friends. He told me I wasn't good enough to be with his wealthy friends. He was drinking while I was in the car with him. The roads were yet and he was driving very fast. I was very frightened. It was after that, that he said those things to me. I went ahead and got dressed and was going to meet one of his friends that he told me I wasn't good enough to meet. I was dressed very nicely. There is so much to this and I don't know what order it goes in. I was with someone but I don't know whom. I don't know if I was married to him. We had gone on a trip and I had bought a lot of Native American items, jewelry, feathers, blankets, etc. It was really fabulous. Our butler wasn't around to help us pack and we were in a hurry and we had a baby and we were trying to grab a few things because we had to meet this duchess/important woman. We just had so many beautiful things. Some of them were very small. I was pulling them off and putting them in drawers and stuff so they would be safe to travel and so we wouldn't lose anything. We just left everything else for our butler, hoping that he would get back and be able to get it all packed up for us in time to catch our train. We went in this special place to meet this woman. She was lying on a bed. I curtsied and shook her hand, as did our nanny/assistant to me. We chatted with her briefly. I had to do different things to make sure I was sitting in the right place and sitting properly, etc. The woman is in a hot tub with her husband and making love to him. We were all trying to avert our eyes. My husband had also been sitting on a bed and he fell asleep. I got up and walked away and I was trying to figure out what to do or where to go. I ended up in a hot tub with someone but I have no idea who it was. It wasn't my husband but a man who truly appreciated me. After Nick R told me I wasn't good enough, I got dressed up and I was going to go meet some woman by myself-one of his wealthy friends. I knew my way out. I thought Oh yes, I know my way out because I dreamt this. I dreamt it earlier in the same dream. I went to this woman and her name was Betty [unknown in waking life] . She was very classy. She welcomed me and she could tell I was upset and she asked me why. I told her and she was very sympathetic. She asked me if I would like some strawberries and cream. I was looking at my assistant and this woman to take the lead on what to do and how to act. I got a very small bowl of strawberries and cream. I didn't go sit with them but rather stood back in a dark spot where I wouldn't be seen in case I did something wrong or spilled something, etc. One of her female staff members came to me and asked me if I would like to go sit down and I said, very truthfully I would really like a place where I can sit and be alone. She took me to this place where I could sit by myself. It was like a bench in a closet. As I was sitting there eating, the bowl was suddenly much larger and fuller than when I started. I was fighting back the tears. I hadn't eaten all day so I was very hungry and very tired. But then someone came in and told me that they had to hide me. So I put my feet up on this bench and they pulled the clothes past me. These two young men came in. It was their closet and they were looking for some clothes. The mother and the staff person were trying to distract them and try to hurriedly select something so they wouldn't discover me but they did. They were so kind and compassionate. They wanted to know what happened and I told them. They told me that he didn't deserve to be with someone like me. They said I have so much love to give and just want to care for someone and be attentive to them. I wanted to go sit with Aunt J and ask her to tell me all about Uncle A. For some reason, at some point I sensed that he was the one I was with. He was protecting me as a spirit protector. There was also something about one or more housing subdivisions. Maybe flying over them?",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-12-09),-0.20205201,-0.13833952,-0.25683433,-0.17521821
345,"I was with Eric and Stephanie Forrester. I think we were watching two of their small grandchildren. One was a boy and another a girl. I think they were playing hide and seek inside the house. It was dark outside. The little girl went outside. There was a lot of greenery. shrubs and such, narrow paths, steps, etc. I knew as soon as she went out she was going to be very hard to follow and keep my eye on her. I called to Eric that I needed him to come out right away to help. I finally grabbed her and brought her back inside but she went right back out. She said something about us trying to keep her inside. She said something like oh yeah, watch this. She turned into a very small chameleon or a lizard or some such and darted into the dirt. As soon as she came back up I grabbed her. At this point, Eric and Stephanie and the boy were out there and they had each grabbed one also. None of us knew which one was the little girl or if any of them were her. We took them and put them in this box. Now they were like snack cakes. We were trying to figure out which one was this little girl. Each of us took a bite off of one thinking that it would make her turn back into a girl. It didn't work. Someone had suggested that if we did that we would figure out which one was her. The little boy just kept eating until they were all gone. As soon as he did he realized what he had done and he got very upset and was crying.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-12-09),-0.21304032,-0.1941604,0.13943742,-0.010965663
347,"Don from the Get Real Challenge on Oprah was at my house. I had the impression that we were just friends but that he was interested in more than that. We were sitting in the kitchen of my birth home. He was having, maybe ill or some kind of medical problem. We went to the bathroom several times. The last time he came out he looked like he was going to fate. He leaned up against the wall, the corner, and was holding on to doorknobs. His face just got blood red, deep dark red. Blood started pouring out of his face. Primarily out of the area of his right eye but it practically covered his whole face. I didn't know what to do. I grabbed some tissue to hold onto to blot up the blood while I called 911. When I called 911. at first I was having difficulty dialing it. I kept dialing the wrong numbers because it was kind of dark and I couldn't see the numbers. Finally got the number and told them who it was and they said, Oh no, not him again.

348,"I was in the kitchen backing chocolate chip cookies for Matthew as a reward for something. I don't know if I forgot about them or what but I came back to the kitchen and the two trays in the oven were very done. I had not even switched the bottom tray to the top yet so I took them out and then I noticed that there were different kinds on the one tray from the bottom. I realized that they were left there from our cookie baking day in December. There were snickerdoodles, chocolate chip cookies and something else. I had newspaper spread out on the kitchen counters and was spreading out these cookies. I ate one or two of them. Some other people coming through the kitchen would grab one and eat them. I said that I was baking them for Matthew. Matthew seemed to be younger than in waking life. BJ came in and said something about these other kinds being in there if I was baking chocolate chip cookies. At first I just kind of grinned at her, afraid to tell her what they were from. She guessed, ah. They were left over from cookie baking day. I said, yes they were. There was another child there working on some homework. At first it seemed like boy and I made some comment about the cookies being a reward and how well that works as a reward. Later it seemed that it was a little girl and she was working off the money that she had wanted and her parents had bought for her. She didn't realize how expensive it was. Somehow I lifted up a piece of paper or something to see how much it cost and it was $300+ dollars. I just thought it was going to take her forever to work off, that she had no idea how expensive that thing was.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-12-12),-0.116112314,-0.025641087,0.090227745,-0.10674228

353,"Matthew and I were moving into this new apartment. It was here in the city where I live yet it was on the beach. It was a big place. It was one story. Had a big screened in porch. There was a lot of room. Bill F and Brian F were moving in with us too. There were two different rooms that I was deciding between for my office. The first one I decided on we had moved all my things into. Then I decided that the other one faced the screened-in porch and ocean so I decided to make that my office instead. That way I could work in there and listen to and feel the ocean. Then there were two other rooms. One for storage and another for a laundry room. It wasn't a fancy place. I was just absolutely in love with it because it was on the ocean and because of the screened-in porch. I kept saying how great it was to be on the ocean and that it was even less expensive than where we were living now. Bev and her family were there helping us move. As we were moving I was asking different people if they had been out to the beach yet. Bev had because she loves the ocean as much as I do and she just thought it was so great. I said, good, now you'll come to visit me more. She said, Absolutely. Especially in the summer. I asked her if she had taken Rachel S out to the beach yet and she said she had and that Rachel S had loved it. Stephen F was there and Mari Kate S. They were being especially helpful. One other thing I remember is that there was a lot of furniture that I was trying to move around in these rooms. I at least wanted to get all of the furniture to the right rooms before everyone left. Some of the furniture was in pieces and had to be put back together.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-12-22),-0.22204868,-0.06227178,0.049646683,-0.1846474
355,"I was at my birth home with all of my siblings. I was trying to talk Bill F and Brian F into switching bedrooms with Bev and me. One of them didn't want to do it but I don't remember why. I was trying to get them to switch, first of all, because Daddy had put a sliding glass door to the patio in their room. I had Sir Gallahad and I had decided to keep him because Bill F was going to be his primary caretaker. If I had the room with the sliding glass door I could put him out on the patio at night and he would be easier to clean up after. Bev didn't want to switch rooms and Bill F didn't want to switch. We talked a little bit about Brian F and Bev sharing a room and Bill F and I sharing a room. But then we decided that was not the best idea at our age. We finally ended up switching bathrooms. We ended up doing a major remodel to the bathroom that was going to belong to Bev and me. When we got done with the remodel it had a kind of Florida feel to it. It was a lot of white wicker. Very spacious. Mother said after we were done that she was really glad we had remodeled because she liked it so much more. We moved the bathtub. We took the shower stall out. It was very nice. We had fixed up a whole closet for Sir Gallahad and for another animal. a duck. Sir Gallahad learned how to talk. I don't remember what he said. The sliding glass doors from the boys room seemed to be at the back of the closet. I had to move all of these clothes out of the way every time I wanted to open or close it. I don't think we were going to put Sir Gallahad out there after all. Bill F and someone else had been working with him and gotten him to a point where the hall closet worked very well for him. I remember what we did but not well enough to describe it. Part of the trick was getting him to stay in there at bedtime. It seems that someone else was involved somehow. But I can't remember who or why. Even though Bev and I were living there and sharing a room, Mari Kate S and Andrew S were also there. After we had finished all of the remodeling we were having problems with the toilet in the boys room. It almost overflowed every time you flushed it. Every time we tried to flush it Daddy would have to run in and stop it before it did overflow. I kept having to go to the bathroom so I kept going to use the one we just finished remodeling. But then the last time we used it we had the same problem there. It did overflow a little before Daddy got in there. Earlier, before we did all this moving around or something in Bev and my room, the housekeeper came in and vacuumed the floor. There were some bugs and stuff. I said, well, that's not my fault. She said, no it isn't. There was all this powder and I said, honestly, all the powder is my fault. We wanted to finish cleaning up from our work in the bathrooms. It was getting late and Bev wanted to get Mari Kate S and Andrew S home. We made Andrew S lie down in the boy's room but that wasn't working because he kept getting up. Then I took him into Mother and Daddy's room and turned out all the lights. There were two toilets in there. One sitting out in the room where their white chair always used to sit and the other was in the closet. Andrew S wanted some milk. I went to the refrigerator. There was a baby bottle in there, partially full. Bev told me to just fill that up and give it to him. I didn't even question the fact that I was giving him a baby bottle. I was just questioning filling that one up and giving that one to him. Somebody said that Mother had plenty of milk so it wasn't a problem. So I went ahead and did that. I took him into Mother and Daddy's room and turned out all the lights. Later he got back up again anyway. I had gone into the bathroom and started cleaning up while everyone else was doing something else. I had gotten most of the mess cleaned up except for scrubbing the floor. When I did that Andrew S was sleeping in there. I asked Bev if I could scrub that while Andrew S was sleeping and she told me no. I took him to Mother and Daddy's room to sleep. I did end up scrubbing the bathroom. Nick R was there waiting for us to get done. He finally said he had to go. It was pretty late at night and I was concerned about him driving home and staying awake. He apologized and said that he was sorry but he really had to go because he had an early morning. Andrew S kept interrupting us. Bev was trying to stop him. I was trying to say good-bye. I walked out into the kitchen and was sitting in the corner of the counter. He moved close to me, in between my legs and said he really wanted another chance. I questioned that it would make any difference. He said that it might not make any difference on the phone calls but it would make a difference in any other way. I was really debating and asked him why it wouldn't make any difference on the phone calls but I woke up before he answered.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-12-25),-0.27169833,-0.0113194715,0.032047138,-0.17196892
357,"I was in a hotel. I was trying to get out and I was flying. Somehow when I was flying to get out I kept getting to one point where I would get turned around and right back to where I was. I no longer had control and something turned me around and sent me back. There were Christmas trees in this hotel with the old-fashioned tinsel. I thought the trees were so pretty. I ended up in this bar. Maybe there were strippers in there. I was lying on the bar and there was a man there who was my bodyguard. I just thought, I don't want to do this anymore. I just want to get out of here. He came with me. He was going to get me out of there. We were trying to leave the hotel, only now there was another couple with us. It was a black couple. As we were trying to leave the hotel, we kept coming to these things that you might see in an amusement park fun house. It looked like; I don't know how to describe it, like one looked like it was a spiral. It just looked like a picture but you could actually walk into it. You didn't know. You had to just walk into this picture and you didn't know what was going to happen. We did that. Then we came to another place that looked like squares that just kept getting smaller. I actually led us into that one. I had some kind of square thing that one was red. The spiral thing was kind of like silver and black. I had this red square. We were going through. It got to a point where it was so small. I realized that we weren't going to be able to go any further. I said, back up. Back up. For some reason I thought we had to do it quickly. This man I was with, my bodyguard. It was he and I and two other women. He got us out of the hotel and we were in a car. He was driving really fast. He headed into the woods on this road. The road was extremely hilly and curvy. I was very scared because you couldn't see what was in front of you. He was totally confident. Some of those hills were so steep down and so steep back up again. The kind that makes your stomach jump. He is going through the woods. All of the sudden we were in water. Our car was floating in the water. I said, roll down the windows and try to grab some bottles or pieces of wood or something that you can use as a paddle. None of the other three would grab anything. I grabbed a bottle and began paddling. I got us very quickly to a dock. It was out in the middle of the water but it was a dock attached to a house. They couldn't believe how quickly I got us there. I didn't tell them but there was an animal underwater that actually pulled us to the dock. It just seemed that I did it. It was a cow, because later it was a cow's head. We got out of the car and these people invited us in. It turned out to be the family of one of the girls that was with us. I think one of the girls with us was named Phoebe and I think it was her family. They loaned us a boat. We were standing on the dock before then. I was talking to Phoebe and said, You know. This is probably the highlight of our life. This trip that we've been on and where we're going. I don't remember where we were going. She agreed. I said, We really need to just enjoy and appreciate this trip while we're on it. Because we will likely never do anything like this again in our lives. Somewhere along here, before Phoebe joined us, myself and this man were in love. This other woman. I think her name was Patty [unknown] but I don't know here. The three of us decided that we would live together. We decided that we would tell people that we knew. When we were driving, we were driving along this field and saw a friend of ours working in this field. We stopped and were talking to him, I think the man I was in love with was named Tom [unknown in waking life] . Tom told this man, Yep, Patty and I are going to live together. He didn't say anything about me. I was really upset and hurt. I didn't say anything. Then I saw a penny along the road and picked it up. Patty and Tom got in the car. I saw a whole bunch of change along the road and I started picking it up. They were getting really aggravated with me. They kept saying, come on. We've got to go. We've got to go. I was picking up all of this change and putting it in my pocket. When I finally got in the car they said, don't you realize what you were doing was illegal? Picking up that money. I didn't understand what they were talking about. why they thought picking up this money that someone had dropped along the road was illegal. They apparently thought it belonged to this man that we stopped and talked to. We were in the car and Tom and Patty both knew I was really upset because of what Tom had said to our friend and that he didn't mention me. Tom took his pants off like he wanted to have sex with me, as though that would make everything better. I wouldn't have any part of that. We were headed into the road. This is when Phoebe was with us now too. Phoebe's parents loaned us this boat. We were in the boat headed someplace. Phoebe was talking about being pregnant. I said, that's alright Phoebe. You and I can get an apartment and I can help you take care of your baby. Everything will be fine. We learned that Patty was pregnant too but it wasn't Tom's baby. I went back to Phoebe's parent's house. The others were attacked by some men on another boat. I hid under the house when they came there. They left. Tom came back and told me that he realized that I was the only one he really loved. We kissed.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-01-07),-0.13898826,-0.22836113,-0.00038006707,0.049279302
359,"I was doing a group meeting or lecture in the living room of my birth home. Most of the people in the group were black. I was talking about the power of the subconscious mind and I gave a couple of examples from my own experience. I was really strongly emphasizing that the foundation of it all has to be unconditional faith- that whatever you are wishing for, whatever you are hoping for, whatever you are trying to manifest has to have a strong foundation of faith that it will happen. And I actually used the words you have to have the faith that God loves me, God wants the very best for me, he wants me to be happy, and he will bring this to me. As I was talking, this one lady kept talking to someone else. I asked her a couple of times to please wait until I finished. She would go on. I would ask her again and finally she did stop. Then when I finished I turned to her and I said okay now if you would share. She said, No, I don't want to now. I said, well, that's pretty childish but okay.

After the funeral was over I went back there to see her and we realized that the people who tried to kill her the first time were out there somewhere so we crouched way down in a field. They came through and they were poking through the weeds with a stick and they just barely missed the top of our heads. It was a good thing that we were crouched down far enough. Fortunately they couldn't see us. And most people still believed that she had died. There were three men involved. The one man, the one who was the head of the ring, the worst character of the three, actually ended up dying.

There was like an old shed on the property that we were moving from so we were just going to move in there. We went to one side of this shed and someone was living in there. It turned out that it was somebody who had just moved their things in there without permission. When we told her that we had to move in there she left. Then we went to the other side and saw that there was room there also. It sounds like a duplex but the doors were on opposing walls. That side was full of junk.

I was to go into Jack P's office through a side door with a cigar box. There were two short cigars in the box but they actually looked like two rosebuds lying on a white cloth. Before my cue he came out and I was standing next to a crewmember. He said to the crew don't have them offer me or ask me to smoke one of the cigars because I don't want to do that. She nodded yes and he walked away. I thought hmmm, when I go on I'm going to ask him to smoke one of the cigars with me. It was my cue and I went on and he was standing on the right end of his desk and I walked around him to the left end and I opened the cigar box and said here, join me. It kind of threw him for a loop. He acted like he couldn't see or something so I moved around the front of the desk closer to him and again offered him the cigar. Then someone else came in and took them and said something and left. We touched and he was saying something to one of the crew about my doing that and so I decided that I needed to go apologize. We were done for the day and he was in his dressing room, I suppose. I went back and excused myself and said, I really wanted to apologize. He kind of looked at me. I said, Well, I was standing right next to the crew person when you said you didn't want me to do that. It bothered me that you just didn't say it to me since I was standing right there. He smiled. I said, but still, that's no excuse and I am sorry that I did that. He seemed to like that. He smiled and said No problem. Don't worry about it. He left. It was a really weird set. When I was going in and out I was climbing over these boxes and up over these walls and back down. One time when I came in there were all of these boxes piled up, some above my head, with stuff like different bright colored paper towels, different colors of toilet paper and all kinds of stuff.

I stopped in and she greeted me, but not with a hug or anything like she would have in waking life. She opened the door and let me in. I went in and tried to have a conversation and I misworded something and she was asking me what was going on so I told her. She said she wasn't going to go back to school. She was very content being a full time mom and homemaker. I thought that was great. Unfortunately, then I worded the next thing wrong, I said if I could stay home and live off someone else I would do it in a heartbeat. That was not the best way to word it. I went on to say, but I would want to continue my dreamwork because I get such a high off it. It is just so much fun and so rewarding. She just looked at me and didn't smile or respond or anything. I tried to repair my first sentence by saying I think it would be great to be at home full-time to take care of the house and things like that. Her youngest daughter, Tina S, came out. Then they had to go to the school to pick up Tara S. She asked me if I wanted to go along so I did. We got to this school and there was a basket with a bunny in it.

She said, Oh, that was just his first coat. If you had waited until his second you would have been fine. I was thinking, that was his second coat. I didn't say anymore. The rabbit in the basket got away and we were chasing it and he hopped up a tree and was hopping around on the branches. We were having trouble catching him. Finally he started back down and I was able to grab him. I held on to him until- Dorothy S went into the school to get Tara S. When they came out they had this stuff in her hands including this really big stuffed pink animal. When we drove to school I was sitting in the front seat with Dorothy S and Tina S was in back. I don't _____ getting in the car. We went back to. On the way back to her house she was talking about exercising and how she has this stationary bicycle that is so easy to do an hour a day on. She has been doing that and how good she feels. While I was watching her walk into the school to get Tara S it looked to me like she was pregnant. I wasn't going to ask if she wasn't going to say anything because I would hate to be wrong. Because that would imply that she looks like she is pregnant, which she does to me. Anyway, she was talking about what great shape she is in from riding this bike, and going on and on. Then I find out right before I leave that her and Tony S both used the Hollywood 48 diet. After we got home these three men showed up and she was playing racquetball in the house with these three men, in the dining room and family room area. She wasn't really talking much so I finally picked up my keys and said, Well, I'm sorry but I need to go Dorothy S. I tried to wait until they took a little break so I could hug her and she just kind of looked at me and kept playing. So I just waved goodbye and headed out the door and left. I tried to leave but I had car trouble. She gave me keys and was going to let me drive Tony S's white Rolls Royce with red interior convertible home. I was trying to maneuver it to turn it around so I could get out with all of these trees around. Either her mother or Tony S's mother went in and talked to Dorothy S and were kind of, not scolding her but, telling her that she really had no idea what it was like be a single parent responsible for everything in the household. earning the income, trying to keep up the house, do a good job raising the children, etc. That she should have been more kind to me and respectful that I am doing all that and continuing my education.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-02-02),-0.1436774,-0.16361025,0.07364588,-0.26639646
371,"I was with family members. It was women and children. We went to an amusement park. We were trying to decide what to do; whether to go ahead and ride some rides or wait for the men to join us. We did ride some rides. On one ride the operator stopped to let someone off and the rest of us in my family decided to get off as well. The men had finally joined us. My husband was a different nationality, dark skinned, about the same height. We weren't walking next to each other. he finally walked up next to me and put his arm around me. He didn't have a shirt on. Average size man. I put my arm around him. I thought it was odd that he didn't have a shirt on and I don't particularly care for men to be out in public without a shirt on. he was sitting and I was standing next to him. I leaned over and I kissed him on the cheek. He gave me a strange look. He said, I don't know why you do that. I said, why, what's the big deal. He just really disproved of any kinds of public displays of affection, even though it was a simple kiss on the cheek. We finally went to this big area, where you could get food and sit down at these long tables to eat. We were sitting there. We had two small children. I don't know if they were twins or simply very close in age. One was a girl and the other a boy. Through most of the dream I thought they were twins. It wasn't until the end of the dream that I questioned that. We were sitting in this dining area and my husband pulled out a gun and shot some people. Then he turned the gun on himself and shot himself in the chest but he didn't die right away. He lied there still for a minute. I was down on the ground next to him, perpendicular to him. I saw him raise his gun and I reached to try to get it away from him so he wouldn't shoot anyway else. Another man was sitting close by and saw. I was weak or injured or something and this other man managed to get the gun away from him. Then my husband died. We are walking toward our cars to go home. I was injured and walking with a cane. I would come to the top of the incline where the floor was polished. It was a really pretty colorful tile. Because it hurt for me to walk I thought I would just slide down the inclines. I would slide until I stopped or until I bumped into something in front of me. I was going to let my daughter stop me at the end. My sister said I couldn't do that because she's so little that I would just knock her over. Of course, she was right. Before we left the amusement park, after my husband died, one of my sisters said, well, Eddie's here. He'll be here for you now. He was either supposed to be my husband now or wanted to marry me. I thought he wasn't that attractive. I wasn't physically attracted to him. He seemed like a nice enough man. I was thinking about this as things progressed. I thought, well, gee with what I've been through you would think he would be a little more attentive to me right now. I was injured and having trouble walking and he didn't really do much to assist me. He didn't ever ask me if I was okay or needed help or anything. I thought that was kind of strange. I was back at my birth home and I was in my bedroom, my two children were in the boy's bedroom. Brian F was there. Daddy was there. I went outside for some reason. Aunt P and Aunt H came. I kind of looked over to Aunt P, hugged her, and started crying/sobbing. She was consoling me. Aunt H went ahead and went inside. I finally went back inside and went into the bathroom. There was something weird about the bathroom but I can't remember now what it was. Then I went back into my room. I just had my robe on and nothing on under it. I was lying on the bed crying. Daddy came in. He was lying on the bed next to me, talking to me and stuff. At this point, it felt like Mother was also dead. So he was talking about how this was difficult for me too. He kept wanting to touch my pubic hair. I kept pushing his hand away and I finally yelled, STOP! He said, why? I said, because it makes me really uncomfortable. He said, well it shouldn't. I said, but it does. He tried one more time and I angrily pushed his hand away and said, STOP IT! He finally got up and left. I was just lying there sobbing and Brian F was fixing lunch. grilled cheese and tomato soup. He asked me if I wanted some. I said, Yes I do. I'll be right out to help. I apparently stayed in my room too long. I went into the other room to my kids and they had been napping and they heard me come in and they both got up came to me. I was just thinking, how am I going to tell them that their daddy is dead. How am I going to raise these two children by myself? I already raised one child by myself. I don't want to do this again. My little girl, she was just a little bit shorter than the boy was. This is when they didn't seem like twins to me. I even questioned it in the dream. Which is really odd they were my children. The little girl asked me where Elly was. She said, mommy. I said, you spend so much time with Elly you think Elly is your mommy. I said, I'm mommy and I'm right here. I guess I didn't tell them about their daddy. I went out to the kitchen to help with lunch and I could see that everyone else was done and Brian F hadn't made anything for me. So, I got stuff out of the refrigerator and I was going to fix myself some lunch. I looked in the living room and Mother was sitting there. I stopped in my tracks. I looked again and I thought, it is mother. I thought, is she alive? So I walked in very slowly and leaned over her. She was sitting on the couch with her head back and looked like she was sleeping. I said, mother? She raised her head and said yes? I just started sobbing and she stood up and I hugged her and I told her that I thought she was dead and I told her how much I loved her.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-02-08),-0.1419357,-0.13675576,-0.3738009,-0.09319754
374,"I was at Kings Island with Daddy and three other family members. I don't know which three. Daddy had gone off by himself somewhere and was supposed to meet us at this one spot. We were sitting there for him for a long time. We realized we didn't have much time before we had to leave and I was frustrated that we had spent so much money on tickets to get in and we weren't going to have time to ride a single ride while we were there. We sat down and continued to wait. We finally decided that we needed to just go try to find him. I didn't want to go off by myself because I have trouble finding my way around there and not getting lost. We just all stayed together and it seemed to me that we were retracing our steps. I don't know. this is sketchy. We covered the whole park and didn't find him. We were going to see if they had any kind of a PA system where they could page him. We didn't know how we were going to find him. It was dark and they were closing up. The employees were starting to go home and we were getting really concerned. We didn't know how we were going to find him. I went in to use the restroom. They had very strange restrooms like in a foreign country where they don't actually have a toilet but rather just a drain in the floor. I heard some employees in the restroom talking. It seems as though someone was chasing us or I don't know. We kept going in and out of these hallways. We would accidentally end up in the men's room so we would just rush through hoping we wouldn't be noticed and finding our way out. But we kept weaving in and out of these, like hallways or something, and couldn't find our way out. It was almost like a maze. We would find our way out into a hallway of the building but then there wouldn't be anyplace else to go except a couple of very small doorways, like children's size doorways. Some child had set-up something like traps and told us at the end of that hallway that we had to go just one way. There is a lot missing and a lot that I simply cannot describe. There was no ceiling on this building. The walls of the building started collapsing like dominoes. We jumped on top of them and were just trying to stay on top of them as they toppled over.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-02-13),-0.25059462,-0.090321265,-0.06858214,0.15840876
375,"I was asleep but experiencing extreme periodic limb movements, both arms and legs. I could hear someone say that I should get up and take some Advil or ibuprofen as that would help it tremendously. However, I couldn't wake myself up to do so. I thought I was crying out help me, help me. But no one was around to hear me. At first I was asleep in my own bed here at home and realized that there was no one else in the house to hear me. The scene shifted and I was in my bed at my birth home and I was thinking that BJ would be coming to bed soon and she would hear me and help me. The scene shifted again and I was an elderly person in a group home. I shared a bed with someone and there were four of us in the room. I was experiencing the same thing but the caretakers refused to give us anything. She was a very mean person. Several of us were experiencing health problems that kept us incapacitated and the caretaker preferred it that way. A new caretaker came and she gave us all the medications that we needed to feel better. We immediately began to feel better and we got out of bed and began doing things and going places. Several of us went to visit our families for the first time in a long time. One of the people died however, having been able to say their good-byes to their family. We were all happy for that person. Because of that death there was a change in bed partners. It wasn't necessarily same-gender bed sharing but there was no romantic or sexual activity either. I think over the course of the dream several people died, but they were all happy at the time of their death. This felt really good. I don't remember the exact transition of all the scenes. I was at this church. I don't recall my age. I was sitting in the pew not feeling well. I thought I was going to pass out. Just as I thought I was going to pass out, I saw myself slump over in the pew. I realized that I had died now also. The monsignor of the church was standing by my side. Even though he was alive, he could see me standing next to him. It was his job to help direct people who were newly crossing over from his church, so he had been given the gift by God to see the spirit of the person who had crossed, just as they had done so. He assigned them a spirit guide to lead them until the person was comfortable being on their own. Before I left with my spirit guide, the monsignor walked me around the inside parameter of the church. On the walls were banners in memory of those who had passed inside the church. He pointed out my banner. The banner said some very nice things about me. I didn't realize it was me, however, until he lifted it and showed me my name underneath. It was an incredible feeling. Especially as we floated into the air and overlooked the people and scenery beneath us. We floated over the cemetery. I saw Grandma F's headstone. I went to the ground and brushed away the grass and leaves. I spoke to her, hoping she would come out and speak with me, but she didn't. I was okay with that, thinking that it just wasn't meant to be, or at least not yet. I arose and continued floating around the cemetery. I saw Father F's headstone and went down to it. My spirit guide said that after passing we can have a wish come true that we know couldn't when we were alive. I really wanted to talk to Father F again so his spirit arose from the grave. My spirit guide left us alone. We had a wonderful chat. I went back inside the church and was looking at the banners again. This time I noticed one for BJ hanging there. There were a number of people/family members represented on her banner. I was surprised to see her banner. that she had died. But I also didn't know who all the people represented. The monsignor, who was now Father M, came up and told me that it was her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. He also told me that she hadn't died yet, but that only I could see her banner as a sign that she would be joining me from that church. Her and her children came into the church for my funeral. They were very sad and I didn't want them to be sad for me. I was very happy. It felt wonderful to be free of the limitations and suffering of the physical body and a physical existence. God allowed her to see my spirit and communicate with her. It provided her with comfort, not only with my own crossing over but with the idea of her own eventual crossing. I did not tell her about her banner and what I knew about her crossing. I went back out to the cemetery for my burial. As I was hovering afterward, I saw my family wandering about the cemetery with the Kidwell family. Aunt A was pointing out that they had purchased burial spots so she, Uncle J, their children and their spouses, would all be buried together. I thought how unusual this was, at least according to the cemetery rules at St. Joe. I went back into the church. There was a mass going on and Father Marty was standing near an inside door. Another priest had just taken over as Monsignor of that parish. As I watched, I saw Father M's spirit leave his body. The new Monsignor directed him to me. I was to be his spirit guide. I welcomed him home. I took him around the parameter of the church and showed him the banners, and pointed out his own banner. I helped him get adjusted to floating. I took him to the cemetery. I told him about the ability to have one wish realized now that would not have been possible while in the physical body. Later, which must have been months or years later, I went to Father M's gravesite and saw that he was completely decomposed. All that remained were the things that he was buried in and with. Still, somehow, I was able to speak to him. I told him I wanted to be with him again, that I really missed him. He said, but don't you see, it's too late now!",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-02-14),-0.06910601,-0.3270313,0.007927741,0.116745114
377,"I was the daughter of a black family. We lived in a bad part of town. One of my brothers went out to play with his friends and we heard shooting. We all got down and got him back in the house. Mother and Daddy, but particularly Mother, was talking about the kind of friends my brother had. My parents were thinking about getting a new bed and then had one delivered to try out. There was hardly room for it in our small home/apartment. I'm not sure which it was. I had a room upstairs that I shared with siblings; I think both brothers and sisters. My brother had some of his friends over for a party. My parents had just gotten new carpet and his friends got peanut butter all over the carpet. I told him he needed to get it cleaned up before they got home but he didn't do anything. I worked on it some but quit. I don't know why. Some of his friends wanted to dance with me. Now I was a white person and his friends were white as well. I was supposed to choose one of his friends after I had danced with several of them. I chose one with long, dark, wavy hair and dark eyes. He had a very smooth, clear complexion and a very kind face. We hit it off pretty well. it was months later and a girl showed up saying she was the mother of this man's children. The children, however, were actually snakes. Real snakes. Two of them were huge. Very long and very big around. They almost looked like cobras as you noticed their hoods when they raised off the ground. There was also one much smaller snake. I didn't want anything to do with them. I hate snakes. I suppose I fear them. Anyway, I was told that I was now responsible for these snakes because I had chosen this man. But he decided he was no longer interested in me. A bunch of his friends were there but they all finally left, and left a huge mess. I noticed that the peanut butter stains were still there and I couldn't believe that my parents had let my brother get away with not cleaning them up. My parents decided that it was time to move into a bigger home. My mother designed a very contemporary and very large house. When we were ready to move we were taking things off the walls and packing. Every time I thought we were done I realized there were still many things on the walls that we had not taken down and packed. I especially noticed that I had missed plaques and things about Matthew and I wanted to be sure not to miss them. The neighbors had some mean dogs, maybe Dobermans. They kept coming into the old house and worrying us as we were trying to pack and move. When we got to the new house I couldn't find my room. I went into the house and it had a very strange type of spiral staircase. The spiral staircase reminds me of something you would see in a Dr. Seuss book. Very odd shaped, large, and bright colors. As I went up the staircase I kept finding bathrooms and I knew who they were for. Then I found some bedrooms and I knew who they were for. But I didn't find my room. I finally went and asked my mom and found out that she did not have a room put in for me. Now the family was black. I'm not sure if I was black or white at this point. I was very upset that I did not have a room and I didn't know where I was going to go or what I was going to do. I finally found my dad and told him what she did. He was upset and just shaking his head. He was and wasn't surprised by what she did. I know that I am not her daughter but I am his daughter. I think he is going to send me to live with a relative until he figures something out. My stepmother told me I could have one of the bathrooms because there were many more bathrooms in the house than there were people.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-02-16),-0.20514338,-0.24392639,-0.14807674,-0.04315487
381,"I was with a large group of people. We went to a prison to do one-on-one counseling with prisoners. I didn't know all the people in the group. Terri O and Audrey T and Karen W were all in the group. We had car-pooled. When we arrived and went inside we had to walk along this ledge. All of the walls had a ledge just a few inches off the floor and only about 4-5 inches wide. We had to walk on this ledge rather than on the floor. We were obviously in single file. When we each came to the person that we were supposed to be counseling then we would go into that cell. We had to climb up into the cell with the prisoner. I was the last one to get to the cell of the prisoner I was going to be working with. I was in a section that was all women. I had past one cell and I thought I past the one I was supposed to go into. Since I wasn't sure I backed up and looked at a sign on the wall to double check. Then I went back and climbed up into the cell with the woman I was supposed to be counseling. There were two women prisoners in that cell. The woman that I was counseling was in the middle of a visit with her five children. I don't remember a lot about the counseling session. Going into it I was somewhat concerned about doing one-on-one counseling with a prisoner. I wasn't sure that I was ready or qualified to do counseling with a prisoner. When we were ready to leave we had to walk on these ledges again. This time, when we were leaving, we got separated. Some of us got lost and were having trouble finding our way out. There was one point that we were walking by the prisoners but they were no longer in individual cells. They were in spaces that remind me of cubicles. There were 6-8 prisoners per cubicle. Half on each side of the cubicle. There were no doors or bars on the end. We were at a higher level than they were so we could see down into the cubicles and see them. Occasionally there were some standing. We finally found our way outside, but we weren't all together. When my group got outside we realized that there had been a breakout. The prisoner's who had broken out had guns so I scrambled to get into a car with some of the other counselors. I think there were five of us in that car. Karen W was driving. We just kept telling her to drive faster. There was a lot of shooting going on. I thought we should all be crouching down in the seats so we wouldn't be hit by bullets coming through the windows. But I didn't say what I was thinking. We did keep telling Karen W to drive faster. I didn't understand why she was hesitant to drive faster. With all the shooting going on, there was shrapnel falling on the roof of the car. As it was falling it was disintegrating the roof of the car. It wasn't coming through the roof, but more like melting it. There was black matter dripping down and landing on us, in our hair and on our faces and sticking. I don't remember that it hurt but I don't think it was going to come off very easily and I think I was concerned about it leaving scars or injuries. Now I was trying to get into a car with someone else. I did. As we were taking off I saw Audrey T running to get into a car. I kept saying that we needed to stop and let Audrey T get in but they wouldn't stop. They said, no, we just need to keep going. I was very upset with them about this. Karen W was driving. This is confusing. She wouldn't stop for Audrey T to get in. We got away. I don't know who I was with. I was with two black women that I don't know. We were out in the country. We came to a place where. I think we went to each of their homes. Each of their homes was like a very small wooden shack. maybe 8 ft by 8-ft square. They were very run down and full of stuff. One of them just had a couple of people in it and the other one had people sitting along all four walls. I was lying out in the grass. I woke up. I couldn't open my eyes all the way or couldn't see clearly. It was kind of like when I wake up and am having trouble with my contacts because I need to put drops in my eyes. I got up and started walking and I could feel the grass under my feet and how rough or uneven the ground was. I bent over and felt the grass and thought, oh, I'm awake. I started walking and then I saw two men walking up behind me. They had been with us at the prison. Now, though, we were all dressed up. They each had on suits. I thought we were all awake.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-02-27),-0.19853267,-0.13140917,0.22196212,-0.0012614619
382,"I was on the beach in Hawaii near the ocean. I was talking to several people. I don't know who was there except for Kendall B. He was there with his wife and kids. There was some other man there as well. I was talking to them. Kendall B's wife and kids got up and left. I continued talking to Kendall B. He said, we have to be very careful here like this. I thought he meant that he didn't want to be seen talking to me with no one else around. So I got up and walked further up on the beach and sat down. Kendall B came back up to me and asked me why I had left. I said it was because of what he said about being careful. He said, that's not what I meant. This is very sketchy. We talked some about what he meant. I'm in my hotel room and he comes in and we talk some more. I went back out to the beach and the palm trees were very low and very thick. I had to push the branches away to get down to the ocean. There were other people around but I don't remember any of them. I spent a little time in the ocean. Either Kendall B and some of his family or just his family were there. I went back with them to their room. I spent time with all of them there. He had two young boys. I was playing with the boys and they asked me to spend the night with them. They were all sharing one bed. I said they didn't have room for me and his wife said, sure we do.

383,"I went to the mall on a Sunday. Macy's was closed, but they had a door open so people could go through the store to get into the mall. It was dark in the store. As I was going through I noticed that they had one cashier working and one of the managers was there. They were letting people shop. The manager saw me and asked me if I would hang some signs for them. Apparently I was an employee but it was my day off. I was really irritated by this because I didn't want to do it because I didn't want to work on my day off. But I also didn't feel that I should say no. I grabbed the signs and I very hastily hung four signs. I didn't do it the way I would have, had I been on the clock. I ran out of tape. As I was getting ready to leave the manager said something to the employee. The employee explained how I had hung them. I had hung two facing in one direction and two facing in the opposite direction. I went out to the mall. There was a deli there. I decided to buy some ham and have it sliced. There was another woman there who was also buying ham and wanting to have it sliced for her own business. One of her hams was the size of a small person. She was dragging it on the floor and she had two smaller hams in her arms. I just had one small ham to have sliced but they made me wait until they were finished with her. So I set mine on the counter and decided to walk through the mall while I was waiting. As I walked through the mall I got lost. I got to one section that was all glass walls and doors that could be pushed open and shut. I got stuck in there. It was kind of like a maze. I was feeling panicky, as I would in such a situation in waking life due to claustrophobia probably. I finally stopped one and asked them to PLEASE help me to get out of there and back into the mall. She helped me to get out of there and back into the mall. But then I still couldn't remember which way I needed to go to get back to where I came in. So, I walked for a little while. I stopped someone else and asked for directions again. They gave me directions. I went up a ramp to one store that she had directed me to. The store was all unfinished furniture. The walls and floor were all the same kind and color of wood so it all blended together. I was walking through that store trying to find my way back out into the mall section that I wanted to be in. I couldn't find my way out so I had to stop someone else. I came to this counter and a man was working behind it. It was the actor that plays Dennis Finch on a weekly comedy program. I asked him for directions. As he was giving me directions he mentioned a place called Chow Chow's that sells great hotdogs. He said I would be walking by that. I said, Oh that sounds wonderful. I love hot dogs. I could really go for a good hotdog right now. Then I noticed that they were selling hotdogs in their store as well. I said, well, you have hotdogs. He made a sarcastic remark. I bought a hotdog from him. He didn't even ask me what I wanted on it. He was just putting all kinds of stuff on it that I wouldn't normally ask for, but I didn't stop him. I saw that they had desserts and asked what they were. One of them looked like a small bon-bon. They were telling me what it was and it was something very rich and exotic. I told them I would take one of them as well. I said, by the way, how much is it? He said, Ten dollars. I said, Ten dollars? I thought it must be really incredible so I was going to pay the ten dollars for it. He said, you're going to pay that? I said, if that's how much it costs. I thought it must be really wonderful to be worth ten dollars. He said, I was kidding you. Then I saw another kind of dessert and said I wanted that at first. He was taking his time fixing it. Kind of playing around. I had one near me and said, this one isn't full. I was still having trouble finding my way back. I finally did find my way back to the ham man. The first woman was gone but so was my ham. The man wasn't sure what I was talking about. I said, I bet you gave it to that other woman and he agreed that he probably had. I decided to just leave. I was in the CAS office. I was very sleepy and didn't want to drive home being so sleepy so I laid down on a sofa in the reception area to take a nap before I went home. While I was napping these other people kept coming in and I don't know who they were or why they were in there. They were Chinese. Maybe they were cleaning people but they had their children with them and the children were playing with some toys. They saw me there sleeping and were trying to be quiet. They didn't realize that I wasn't really asleep and knew what they were doing. I finally got up and said something to one of them because I couldn't get to sleep and I got frustrated.

Then I was going up this road towards this path and I came up to an intersection. It was raining and there was something for me to step over as I crossed the intersection. I was thinking that I was looking for an intersection with a traffic light. I also remembered that I often miss that intersection and have to turn around and come back. That's what I did this time too. I turned around. I stepped off the path onto this farmer's property. As soon as the way was clear I got back on and headed back down. It seems as though when I stopped at the bottom of the path while I was talking to this man, there was somebody else behind me. He was also within earshot but I don't recall him participating in the conversation. The vehicle was like a sled but it has wheels instead of running blades. You can use it on any kind of surface or terrain. I was taking it for a ride, I guess is the best way to describe it. I went up this road and then go off onto a path that goes up a hill and then it leads into a park. From there I just picked it up and walked back to the car. When I was on my way to the path, I went to far and had to turn around and come back. When I turned around and came back, there was a fork or something and I took the wrong fork maybe. I was in this really wooded area. I was right along the edge. It was very narrow. There was hardly room to walk and I was on a kind of stone ledge. I could see the path just a few feet below me but too far to just jump off. I had to work my way backward to get back down on the road where I was supposed to be. Then I went back down to where I needed to be to go up the mountain path. I got to the bottom of the path. There was a man sitting there checking people in before they went up the hill. We were talking about exercise. I was talking about my blood pressure being so high and that being kind of dangerous. He warned there had just been a storm and that the path was rough right now. I thanked him for that. He was sitting there. I didn't want to get on my skateboard, for lack of a better description, where he could see me because I didn't want him to laugh or anything. I also had a blanket with me. Maybe I put the folded blanket on top of the sled to lay on. I started walking up this hill but it was so steep that I could hardly walk up. I would use my left foot to plan and then kind of pull my right foot up behind me. I had my left toes twisted towards the right, until I got out of sight from him. Then I was going to get on my skateboard, but the path. Some women came running down the path past me. The path was so full of leaves and branches and such that I had to keep walking. As I was walking I was using my hand to brush away the leaves and such off the path for anyone who came behind me. There was a tree trunk, a tree that had fallen. Instead of being across the path it was long the path the other way, leaving very little path to walk on. So I had to just keep walking. Then I came to a place there was a really big limb. I still couldn't ride. I had to keep walking. I got to a place where there was a big ball of plastic along the path attached to branches and stuff. I got it free and let it fall down the hill towards a house that was on the left at the bottom of the hill. I got past it. Right past that the path ended at a drop off. The drop off was very steep. The path was very narrow, almost had a point. Three sides around me dropped way down. I was really scared at that point. I was confused. I didn't know where to go. I couldn't believe that the storm had taken the path away. literally. It was a wide space between where I was and up ahead. There was no way you could even attempt to jump across. So I was looking around to try to decide what to do and was thinking about the situation. It was just unbelievable to me that this had happened. I turned around and I saw back and to my right some women were coming up towards the path that I was on. They were coming from a different direction. So I thought I would back down and then go off on the path where they were. But as I was backing down, there was so little path that I was very afraid of falling. I was looking for something to hold on to, to steady me. I reached for this branch with my left hand and then I was reaching for it with my right hand also and became very unbalanced. What I was reaching for wasn't there. The end of the branch that I was holding with my left hand just wasn't long enough to grab with my right hand too, but it was also pulling me forward a little bit.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-03-06),-0.121787086,-0.08255373,0.11559662,0.40409014
386,"I was giving dream lectures as the guest speaker at an elementary school in a class. I did several in one day for a variety of ages. I also did one at a high school. No, I think this was a college class. One of the men was attracted to me but would not say anything to me. I don't know how or why I knew that. There was also another man that carried on like he was attracted to me but I think it was just a ploy to get me to help him with something he shouldn't be doing. We went to a reception. There were a lot of refreshments. The man who was just acting like he was interested in me kept trying to convince me to hold on to his marijuana joints for him. I didn't want to have anything to do with it. He kept trying to sneak it under plate somehow. I kept saying no. Someone else, I think one of the college personnel found it and this man told him that it belonged to me. I denied it and said it belonged to him and that he had been trying to get me to hold on to it so he wouldn't get caught. After that I went out to a parking lot but I don't remember what happened after that. I started going to this school's basketball games. The one man that I knew really was attracted to me but wouldn't say anything to me was on the team. First I thought he was a player but later he was the team mascot. Everybody loved him. I went to one of the games and there was a special section that I always sat in. For some reason the people who sat in that section were significant but I don't remember why. I went up to the registration table to find my seat. The man who was signing me in said there were only two seats available. I asked him who was on either side of the empty seats. He said that he was one of them. I said that's good. The other seat was saved for the man that was attracted to me. I was cheering through one of the games and then winning some games or that game. For some reason, this college man wasn't involved in the game anymore because of something that was going on. He was frustrated or discouraged. I finally talked him into participating again. This is the point where he became the team mascot. At the final game, he put on the mascot uniform and came running out onto the floor and everybody was cheering and ecstatic that he was back. It seems that maybe I dated this man and then got married. We did end up getting married. We were definitely soulmates. Very much alike in our values and our ideas and ideals, our philosophies about life. We could not have been better matched. It was quite wonderful. He was attractive. We lived in this very small house that was very run down. We had a very active sex life. Very passionate and intense and frequent. We were taking pictures of each other's genitals but I have no idea why. It was not for any erotic purpose. We were talking about the beauty of the human body, especially the genital area, and intrigue of how the male and female genitals were created so differently. We took the picture and wanted to get them developed but we found out it was going to cost us $12,000 to do that. Obviously, we didn't. I think we were going to use them for artwork. At this point I was the woman but watching the dream also. I was tired of the physical state of the house we were living in. I wanted to move into a bigger and a little bit nicer home. Nothing big and fancy but just not something that was so rundown and falling apart. I also wanted something just a bit bigger. This created quite a rift in our relationship because he was very content where we were. One of the things that was nice is that when we got married we were both so okay with living in that house. For some reason I changed and wanted to live in a bit bigger and nicer house.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-03-07),-0.0019037876,-0.24895301,-0.20322137,-0.084959365
387,"Many members of my family had come to the city where I live to attend my child support hearing with me. I was living in a house. It was just a series of problems. I was rushing around because I didn't want to be late. They were doing different things to slow me down or to impede my timeliness or schedule. I was living in a house, maybe in a house on Lakeland Dr. I was thinking about the laundry room and the backdoor there. BJ said something about me having a backdoor and I said, yes, we have a backdoor in the laundry room. She said something about it and I said, well, it's not like we hang out in the laundry room. We finally got in the car. Someone else was driving. I was sitting in the back seat and trying to give them directions. I could hardly see. They were driving really fast. They missed one turn. We got on, I think it was 82nd St. but it didn't look like 82nd St. in waking life. They were driving very fast and were in the wrong lane. Because they were in the wrong lane they ended up on I-70 and weren't supposed to be there. As soon as we realized what we had done we pulled off and started backing up through the median trying to get back where we wanted to be. There were some workmen who were just watching us. It didn't look like we were going to be able to get back. We couldn't get to the other lanes where we could head the other direction on the other road. We kept backing up and then we had intended to try to back up in the grass back on to 82nd St. Bill F, Brian F, Mother, BJ, Rachel S were all there. We all ended up in different places. I said, You left Rachel S alone? Brian F said, Well Bill F was going after her. I was just freaking out that they had done that. Rachel S is only 3. Several of us ended up on a boat headed somehow between the highways. Someone else was on something in front of us. We were pulling on this rope to move the boat forward and get us where we wanted to be. Whoever was in front of us joined us on the boat. We all ended up together, with Rachel S. While we were on this boat it was raining or storming. We had two things of candles and two plates with two pillar candles on each. Julie D was with us at this point. She was saying something about the candles being lit so I was trying to protect them from falling over and causing a fire or burning anyone. We finally ended up at the child support office where we were supposed to be. My attorney was trying to be very nice about my whole family being there but she realized that we shouldn't talk in front of them. She tried to find a place where she and I could talk privately. I pointed to two sofas that were positioned into an L shape. I suggested we sit there and talk. She said that was fine. Then she said No. Let's go to one of my associate's offices. So went there. I had the feeling that she was going to be very effective and that she was very understanding, sympathetic with my case, of the same beliefs.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-03-08),-0.24093239,-0.27747774,0.12792346,0.21520902
397,"I was sharing a hotel room with a woman. [unknown] I don't know if I knew her in the dream either. We were getting ready to check out. We were packing. She got packed very quickly and was waiting for me. We were going to go out together. Someone else came in the room that was in our group, I guess. They chatted for a little while and were teasing me about how much I had to pack. Everything was not folded yet or anything. I had wet bath towels. I said something about how I was obviously not going to do laundry before I went because of lack of time. So I was just going to take everything home wet. The towels and everything. The other person left and I was just going to throw everything in the suitcase the way it was. This person that I had been rooming with started folding things for me. I started collecting my things while she was folding. She commented on a couple of pair of shorts that I had. that they were nice. I said, yes, that's one of the advantages of having a teenage son. Every time he doesn't want something anymore he just gives it to me. She said, that's a nice way to get some nice clothes. I continued packing. It was taking me awhile. Now Brian F was in the room. While I was collecting my toiletries in the bathroom, I noticed my roommate had left a lot of things in there. I said something to her but she said she was just leaving it. I went to the dresser in the room and found more of her things. Again she said she was just leaving them. I went back into the bathroom. Brian F apparently got tired of waiting and he and my roommate decided to go ahead and leave. I got a little bit upset because I knew if Brian F wasn't there she would have waited for me. So I was just kind of short with them and said, no, that's fine. Just go ahead and go. I finished up and went down. At this point I think I was in Banff because I was with my CIISC. Mary Kay C, Karyn L, Bonnie K, and others were starting to say goodbye. We were crying. It was hard to say goodbye. It was especially hard for me to say goodbye to Carmen A. Her and I hugged for a long time. I was taking my suitcases out. I had this cart and it had two bales of hay on it. I had to push it through the grass to get to where I needed to go. As I did that one of the bales of hay fell out. There was a man sitting out front that was supposed to be part of the hotel's display. He was a model. When he saw the bale of hay fall off, he got up to help. He took a bale of straw from his sleigh and put it up there. I told him he couldn't put it up there because it was straw. He didn't know what the difference was. He put it down. He grabbed something else and put it up there. Again, I said, no, that's straw too. You can't put that up there. So I grabbed a bale of hay and put it up there. I finally went into the room where some of the cohort members were. We were waiting in this space. We had to climb up into this very small space. I was feeling very uncomfortable because I am claustrophobic. I was also unsure that I could fit through these small spaces. I stayed on this ladder and looked in. It was very full. There wasn't any room for me anyway. I saw my roommate in there with Brian F. I said something about needing to leave soon. She said, Why? We have almost two hours. I said, yes, but I was told we needed to be at the airport two hours in advance. She said, well, my agent said one hour in advance was fine. Brian F agreed with her. There wasn't a lot I could do. Sometime before that I was talking to people about flights. I had a 5:15 am flight so we needed to be at the airport at 3:15, which meant we needed to leave the hotel by 2:45. So I think we decided just to stay up and not even try to sleep before then. Terri O said something about how early the flight was. I think when we were having that discussion we were in a small meeting space together. We were all sitting around on the floor. I'm not sure what we were doing. When I was standing on this ladder and just after I said that, someone said that we all needed to get on the bus that they were taking us all on the bus at the same time to the airport. I was kind of relieved that we were going to go ahead and go early. For some reason now I was one of the last ones to get on the bus. I know I had a lot of luggage. My roommate kept saying something to me about my one piece of luggage. She kept saying that I would have to check it and I said I wouldn't. She said, well you know they have to fit under the seat. They are very strict about that. I said, yes, I know. And it does. She said this a couple of times. I said, I've used this before and taken it onboard with me. She finally walked away, but in a snit. As we were getting on the bus I was concerned that all my luggage had gotten on there. Brian F and I were the last ones. They were starting to pull away. Brian F jumped on the back of this pickup truck and was just holding on. I was running along. He kept telling me to go somewhere else. I finally said, Brian F, would you just grab my hand and help me get on? He did. At this point everyone was in trucks instead of buses. Well, some kind of truck like vehicles. It seemed that they were attached or something, kind of like a train would be. But they were all open so we could still talk to each other. Someone on the inside about being so uncomfortable. I said, well, at least it's better than this. I can just barely hang on riding on the outside of this truck. I was concerned because I had hardly anything to stand on or to hold on to. I was concerned about going around turns and hills and things. We were at the airport and getting our luggage to go check in. I couldn't find my purse. I was panicking. I was going different places to see if anyone had turned it in. We saw a couple sitting different places. We looked at them but they weren't mine. Then I saw one that looked almost exactly like mine but realized it was just a tad different. I finally realized I was just going to have to try to do without it. I was sitting in the airport waiting. I was sitting next to this young boy, maybe 10-12 years old. He had a marker and was drawing pictures on his leg. I must have bumped him. Or at least he blamed me for causing him to mess up what he was drawing on his leg. So we talked a little bit. I asked him if he wanted to see me draw something on my leg. He said sure and handed me the marker. It was brown, so I drew a Herman on my leg. He liked that. Then I drew a picture of a woman's face. Everyone thought that was very good. When we were in the trucks there was a box that had all these markers and things in it. I was asking who they belonged to. People didn't agree with each other on who they belonged to. I said it sure looks like the markers and things that belong to the cohort. I said, They were in a plastic container. Someone else said, yes, but someone took them out of the plastic container and put a bunch of socks in the container. This bothered me a bit that they had done that.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-03-23),-0.21138877,-0.21339433,-0.07109235,-0.34866264
399,"A lot or relatives from the Harris family had come to my birth home to visit me. It was mostly women and children. Joan W. was there. The only male I remember being there was Larry K. The women had come to see me because they knew that I had been through some kind of trauma and they were coming to offer support and comfort. They came because my immediate family would likely not be offering any type of support and comfort. Particularly, Aunt P and Aunt H were trying to be comforting. I went out to the woods and someone was out there with Larry. They were playing games with the children. I played with them for a few minutes and then went back in to the house. I was in the bathroom and could see several people standing right outside the bathroom window. I was moving around cautiously because I didn't want anyone to see me in there. Matthew and I are in some kind of a vehicle, in seems to be a car. We are driving down to my mother's hometown because I decided I wanted to go down and talk to Aunt P and Aunt H. I decided to go down and see them because I had a dream about them. As we were driving down there we saw Aunt H walking towards us. We stopped and turned around. I yelled out the window, hey, you want a ride. She said, Sure. She walked around the car and got in. She was on her way to work at Kentucky Fried Chicken. I told her I was on my way down to see her and Aunt P. She asked why. I said I had a dream that I had talked to them and since I honored my dream I decided I should come down and talk to you. So we went ahead and took her to work but it turned out that she didn't have to work. We headed back to her house but now we were in some other kind of vehicle. It was shaped kind of like a luge but it ran on something like railroad tracks and it was open. It was almost more like a half of a pipe, enclosed on both ends. Matthew and I were sitting on it. Somehow we had to use our hands or our legs to make it go. Aunt H or Aunt P was going to go with us but there wasn't room inside for them. Then Mother was there. I didn't want to go then because I can't talk to them as freely if Mother is there.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-03-25),-0.022658875,-0.33531344,0.05952018,0.052888438
401,"I took in a roommate. She was a black woman about my age. During the day she babysat children here in our apartment for a living. She was also a very good cook. She had people over for meals. I said this would work out great because I don't like to cook. We decided that she would do all the cooking in exchange for me cleaning the bathrooms. For some reason I headed upstairs to my bedroom. She had gotten rid of all of my furniture and personal items, everything that I had hanging on the walls. She had replaced it all with all of her own things. It was all an African-American motif. She had even had some remodeling done without my knowledge. I was very upset by this. Partially because we hadn't discussed this but also because she got rid of all of my things. She simply took over all the space and left no space for Matt Or me. When I went back downstairs I realized that she had done it there as well. I was speaking with one of her relatives. This relative said it just wasn't right that she had done that and I was just going to have to break our agreement and tell her that she was going to have to move out. The relative said she wouldn't change. that it would be her way or no way with her. I told her and she was very upset but she got all of her things out right away. I don't know if I hired an attorney or what. Someone heard about what had happened and had gotten different stores to give me all new furniture, new carpet. It was Beautiful cherry wood furniture. The latest in technology. radios, TV, computer, etc. Some of her relatives stayed around and was helping me get settled. They were very nice. They felt very bad about what this woman had done to me.

405,"I attended a class reunion at my high school, ECHS. The reunion began with introductions in the auditorium, though the auditorium did not look like the waking life auditorium. Liz C was there leading the program and introductions. When I first came in I sat near the back and alone. There weren't many people there yet and I didn't know the ones who were there well enough to say hello or sit with them. I saw someone come in that I thought was Audrey T. She sat a few rows in front of me. She introduced herself to the group as Audrey T but did not mention her academic activity. I stood up and said something because I thought she should be recognized for it. A little later this person stood up and turned around to get my attention to tell me she wasn't the same Audrey T. Later in the program I was sitting closer to the front and to the left of the stage, left facing the stage. Audrey T and Paulette W were sitting next to me. Audrey T good-naturedly asked me about it. I apologized and said, you wouldn't believe what I did. I'm the absent-minded professor. Paulette W said, me too. That's what people call me. I said, That's what I tell people to call me also. It's the most comfortable explanation I have found for the silly mistakes I too often make. I explained about thinking she was another Audrey T. It was my turn to introduce myself. I jokingly said, are you sure you're ready for me? I talked about my dream work, my studies, and my future goal to write and do research. Everyone cheered and clapped. They were excited that we were finally going to have a Dr from our class. I went back to the back of the auditorium again and was talking to some of the men who weren't participating much, actually nodding off, that I knew and generally speak with at reunions. Don St, Bill Cra, Joe L, and Mike Kn. We joked a little at their lack of participation. As I was sitting there Darren came up and said hello. I said hello and walked away. In the meantime, some of us were dancing. Dwight W had introduced me to his wife and asked me to dance. I danced twice with Dwight W. He became aroused while we danced and was trying to make sure no one noticed. During the second dance he wasn't as careful and some of the other men noticed. His wife became a little agitated. I went up to her and spoke to her and apologized and smoothed things over. She realized I did not do anything intentionally. Paulette W was chasing after me, bullying me, trying to coerce me into doing something I didn't want to do. As in high school, I didn't have the courage to stand my ground and say no, so I did as she had asked. I put on part of the school mascot uniform and was walking around the school with others doing similar things. There were maybe 12-20 of us. One of the teachers came up to us and told us we had violated his classroom and demanded that we make amends. The task he gave us to do seemed to take quite awhile. When we finally finished and went to the cafeteria, almost everyone was gone. Soon people came back into the cafeteria saying they had just left for a little while. The reunion was not over at all. Later Darren was provoking me on purpose, with some of his buddies. I was getting very aggravated. At this point I'm not sure where we were in the school. He seemed to be on a lower level than I and I was peering down at him from a balcony of sorts. I had a pole or something in my hand and I swung it at him to get him to stop. It hit him in the neck and I thought I might have killed him. Someone went up to him and his head broke off. The man said I couldn't have helped it because he was frozen solid and of course his head would just break off like that. I wanted to call 911 immediately and see if they could save him. Everyone else thought it was useless but there were mixed feelings about how to handle it. Some wanted to call 911 and the police and simply report what had happened as it was an accident. Others, including Dwight W, wanted to hide the whole thing because they wanted to protect me. I was simply walking around in a daze. I couldn't believe what had happened. I just kept thinking that I killed my son's dad and that I was going to have to tell him that his dad is dead. All of the men there, though arguing, began to try to cover up what happened. In the meantime, police arrived and wanted to know what was going on. They kept trying to question me, but I was in a daze and could not even think or speak. I was simply walking around in this daze and trying to get out and go home without even thinking about that being my purpose or why I wanted to do that. Dwight W kept trying to get me out of there but the police kept seeing me and trying to keep me in the school. The men had put up very large pieces of cardboard all over the place in what seemed to be a basement, trying to hide any evidence and trying to hide Darren's body. It felt like a maze down there. I kept getting lost. I would find a way out and then someone would spot me and pull me back in. Sometimes I would actually get outside but had something like a medical bed to get home on and had to power it myself. I was trying to find the best way home to not be spotted. Still I would end up back in the basement. This happened too many times to count. Some of the ways out were square openings in the wall that I needed to crawl through to get out. Then I began getting lost. I could no longer find the ways out that I had found earlier. The square openings I found were much too small for me to crawl through. When I found one Dwight W was standing there and encouraging me to go through, thinking that I could fit. I told him there was no way I could. The square was maybe 12 inches square or less. The fact that a death had occurred had finally become known to the authorities, though they could not get any details from anyone and could not find the body. They brought in a large crew of people and began emptying everything out of the basement in an attempt to find the body and evidence. They had me help load cardboard and stuff into trashcans to be taking outside. I continued to try to find a way out and would keep getting pulled back in. Dwight W and some of the others were moving larger things out, such as large racks of luggage and mattresses. This one woman directed me to begin emptying the racks of graduation gowns into trashcans. She said they all needed to be destroyed now. There were a couple of times that I simply tried to hide behind the cardboard or the luggage or mattresses. Dwight W was afraid I would be found and wanted me to get out of the school. Because of the state I was in the authorities decided to allow one of my sisters to come and get me and take me home. When we were outside another of my sisters came running up with some of her friends and was told what happened. Neither my sisters nor their friends could believe that I had done such a thing with intent to kill. I found myself back in the basement cleaning up and putting the gowns in the trashcans. As I was doing this I realized they were coming very close to finding the body. I decided that, regardless of what the others thought, I was going to tell the authorities what I knew about what actually happened. I went outside and found the women who had been giving me directions and she took me to the man who would take my statement. I asked if I could give it in a private area rather than with all those people around. He was very warm and kind and told me not to be frightened.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-04-19),-0.24179104,-0.0736529,0.137991,-0.19483323
406,"I was at my birth home. Some of my family members were there. I played in the backyard a little bit with Rachel S on the swings. She was laying with her stomach on the swing. There was another little girl swinging right next to her. I was afraid they were going to hit each other because the other little girl wasn't swinging straight. I went towards the house. We were building a new house next door for Uncle E. I had asked them to leave certain jobs for me to do because they were things I really enjoy and that I knew I could do them well. But then I kept not getting around to them and I was feeling guilty because I had committed to these things and asked the others to save them for me yet I wasn't getting around to them. This whole image of building a new house for Uncle E and my concern about these jobs that I had committed too. This time I went in to the house we were building. I was going to start painting. I realized that the last time I had painted I had left the paint can open. I was afraid the paint wouldn't be good any longer. But Mother went in and just picked up a roller and started painting, so I guess the paint was fine. She asked me how much I still had to do. I told her that Daddy said I had to do ten coats. There were spots all over the walls where I had done trim and prep work. Mother pointed out that I hadn't done along the ceiling yet. I acknowledged that. But I also said that trim is easy when the walls and the ceiling are the same color I knew Bev was sitting alone in the backyard so I went and asked her if she likes to paint. She said yes and came in to help. Brian F was also in there painting. We were painting a light green over a dark green. It was very dark in there and I was having trouble seeing. The others weren't complaining. Daddy brought me a light but it didn't help that much. only in very small areas at a time and I couldn't move it around easily. This was a very big room. They were not even finished constructing the interior walls, so it was very odd that we were painting already. I started to paint around a light switch. I got paint all over the switch plate. I was trying to wipe the paint off. I decided to find a screwdriver and remove all the switch plates. Mari Kate S asked me why I wanted to do that and I told her that it is much easier to paint around those areas if you remove the switch plates first. I removed the screws and switch plate that I had just painted over but I dropped three of the four screws. I was getting very agitated trying to find the screws that I dropped or trying to find replacements. I kept walking around and around the room, looking through piles of stuff lying all over the floor trying to find these screws. The main part of the dream was me just going over and over and over trying to find screws. I was having trouble getting around. There were a lot of chairs in there and I really just wanted to clear it all out so I had room to move but it didn't seem to be bothering anyone else. There was talk about having dinner because we had been working for quite awhile. Someone mentioned having burgers. I wanted chicken. Someone mentioned Kentucky Fried Chicken. The majority wanted that then but my parents would never eat that.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-05-04),-0.2550156,-0.13559012,0.21202028,-0.09403496
407,"I think everyone that was working on the house was getting really tired. Some of the construction workers started drinking and some of them got very much out of control. Some of them were coming on to me, but some simply because they were drunk and one or two were earnest in their affection. A lot of them were getting very boisterous and acting very rowdy and inappropriate, taking their clothes off and such. I decided to try to get away from the mess. I headed to my car but was afraid to go all the way to my car because of some of the men around it and because some of the drunken workers were driving their cars around there like maniacs and I didn't want to get hit. I also had Rachel S with me. Someone offered to walk me to my car but then they almost got hit. Another woman arrived and offered to let me use her car. We had to do something with child car seats. A very heavy rain came and was causing a small flood. Some of the cars were halfway deep in water. I was trying to get away. Someone gave me a parachute and walked with me, there was a group of us, to this bridge. We had to jump off the bridge and then open our parachutes. We couldn't see anything but clouds below us so we had no idea what we were jumping into. Some of them were scared because I opened my parachute too soon. I think I was holding Rachel S while I did this. I landed just fine. Then we had to jump into these boats on this river. I did that with no problem. There were lots of dishes, and decorative items floating in the water. I saw people gathering things. I gathered a few items. Just as I was getting ready to get out of the boat I learned that we were allowed to keep anything we gathered. I was disappointed that I had not gathered more. I didn't seem to have Rachel S any longer. I asked how to let the boat know when I needed to get off to get to my car. Now my car was in a different lot and it was daylight. Someone told me to pull on something and then would slow and pull to shore. I got off and walked about two blocks to my car. I was back to where I had to jump in the boat in the river. This time I knew about gathering things so I was able to gather up quite a few things. One woman gave me her car keys and instructed me to go get her car and pull it up to where the boat would pull to shore so we could easily load up all the things we gathered. Anyway, she got in trouble for parking her car somewhere that it wasn't supposed to be. They let me off the hook when they realized I didn't know anything about it, that I was just trying to do her a favor by coming to get her car.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-05-05),-0.109653726,-0.3050593,0.11259707,0.2101049
408,"I think it was Matthew and I moving back to Lakeland Dr. I think I went to the owners of the home we used to own there and asked them if I could go in and look around. We went in and I was amazed at all the changes. They had gotten rid of the laundry room and the large deck we had built on the back. They had also put in a basement. I don't know how you add a basement to an existing house. For some reason the neighbors didn't want to accept me. the neighborhood seemed very nice, just as it was in waking life. At another point it seemed like it was very rundown and dangerous. At another point in seemed almost cartoonish in things that were in the street etc. At another point I was either a part of family that lived there or maybe a friend or simply an observer. The adult male in the family was prone to violence. The family members often tried to avoid him or hide from him when they felt he was dangerous. For some reason I didn't shy away from him. I seemed to be the one that was able to manage him and help him through his anger without hurting anyone.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-05-05),-0.15285975,-0.15178323,-0.10671382,0.18672818
409,"I was very excited to see Uncle A. I was at St. Joseph church. The church had hardwood flooring. The majority of the floor was raised about three steps. When you entered the main part of the church you had to go up 2-3 steps to get to the pews. For some events they would move the pews back, or around, to make the floor more like a stage. They had moved all the pews to the back of the church and the lowest level. Father came back near the pews but remained on the top level. When I came in I saw Uncle A and Aunt J sitting in one of the pews. I was so excited to see him. I immediately went and sat next to him and told him how long I had been waiting for this and I had so much to say and so many things I wanted to ask him.

412,"I was at an intensive. I couldn't room with Carmen A because she was rooming with Lorna B. I don't know why I wasn't rooming with Jo V. I was rooming with two new cohort members. I had to share a bed with one of them and that person didn't like me. She was being very mean to me in the room and I heard she was saying some very ugly things about me in group sessions. One of the things that she said, apparently standing in front of the entire group at a program, Who does that woman think she is? How dare she talk about articulating something related to dreams. Though those weren't her exact words. I was feeling very upset that she was attacking me like that, both in the room and in front of any groups of people. One time I went to the room, I was going to bed early because I wasn't feeling well. I turned the heat up because I was cold. I put on my flannel pajamas, grabbed an extra blanket and proceeded to get in bed. As soon as I got in bed she turned the heat back down. She started verbally attacking me to face then. I decided to get up and leave the room so I went into the bathroom. I partially changed my clothes so I could go out. I went out into the hallway and get a Diet Sprite. I saw Terri O. She noticed I was crying and asked me if everything was okay. I said yes. She knew better because she could see I was crying and upset. But she just cheerfully said okay and started to walk away. I was really surprised and hurt by that. I did want to talk to someone about what was going on. Then I saw Mary Kay C and Karyn L and told them what was going on. Unfortunately they already knew because they had been in one of the programs where she had made one of her comments. Karen W and Julie S were also aware of what was going. On my way back to my room Karyn L and Karen W were standing together and whispering. I made some sarcastic remark because I felt they must have been talking about me because they quit talking as soon as they saw me. I said, That's right Karen W. I said some other thing, but the rest wasn't very nice. I had seen Karen W and Julie S in my room earlier with this other woman. I thought they might agree with her. I went back to my room. Karen W and Julie S came into my room a few minutes later. They weren't doing or saying anything to defend me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-05-15),-0.052401178,-0.28794202,0.020623565,-0.27330923
413,"I was back at the old house on Lakeland Drive for a visit. I looked out the patio door and saw that they had removed the deck. I went to the backdoor in the laundry room and opened it. They had made the yard much higher, the height of the door, both to the left and to the front of the door. You could step out about 3 or 4 feet. In the grass directly in front of the door there were cement strips. They were about 5 feet long and only about 6 inches wide. They went to the top of the yard and had about 12 inches of grass between each one. I tried to use them to step up and see the yard but wasn't successful because they weren't wide enough. I stepped back inside and tried to close the door and saw a snake hanging from the top of the door. I grabbed something and tried to knock it off and to the outside and close the door quickly but there was another. I swung at it a couple of times and couldn't knock it out. As the dream progressed there were snakes everywhere in the house. I don't like snakes at all so I was panicking and terribly frightened by all of these snakes.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-05-16),-0.048068717,-0.17961799,0.23143838,0.2634505
414,"I went to the BE Retreat Center for an appointment with Sister Toni. As I was walking in I realized I had left my planner in the car and would need it to schedule my next appointment. I turned around to go back to my car and I couldn't remember where I had parked. the parking lot was different than in waking life. There were three rows for parking. I couldn't remember the correct row or position in the row. I guess I just decided to forget it and go on in. I entered the building and was waiting in Sister's office for my appointment. Various people came in and out. Susan J was there. She was laying in the fetal position, facing the wall, in a corner of the room by the desk. I was sitting at the desk at this point. She was crying and very upset. Someone told me that someone close to her had recently died. I recognized the name, though I don't remember the name actually being used in the dream. I said, No wonder she is so upset. Still I could not recall her relationship with this person, only that she had been very close to him. It was a male. I knew it was not her husband. I questioned if it might have been her brother or her son. Her daughter also came to mind, but I think only to help me place Susan J's son. Doctor W came in the office. He saw me but did not say a word, acknowledge me, or anything. He simply laid something on the desk, turned, and walked out.

415,"Nick R called and said he wanted to come back. As usual he was apologizing profusely etc. I told him no and reinforced why I was saying no by reminding him of things that we had both discussed before. He said he was coming anyway. I told him I would not let him in. He arrived and broke into the house. I was in bed. He came up to my bedroom and lay down next to me in bed. I told him he had to leave, that I did not want him there. I was half-asleep and had trouble waking myself up. He had undressed before getting into bed. I finally became fully awake and got out of bed. He chased me around the bedroom a bit, thinking I was playing around I guess, but I wasn't. I went downstairs and was becoming frightened. I asked him repeatedly to leave but he refused. Matthew showed up but he was much younger than in waking life. I managed to get into the kitchen and I pulled out a butcher knife. I handed it to Matthew to use if he had to, while I tried to call 911. I couldn't get through to 911. I tried several times. In the meantime, Matthew had stabbed Nick R 3 or 4 times in the stomach. Nick R just looked down at Matthew with the knife still in his stomach. Nick R is laying on the floor, but still alive. Matthew and I are upstairs and I decide to just call the local sheriff's office. Before they could arrive Nick R managed to get up and leave the house. He got in his car and drove away very fast. The next time my dream group met I felt I needed to tell them what happened in case Nick R should show up again, and also to explain my current state of being, nervousness. Two people got up and left immediately without a word. One of them was Alice S from my church. The others left at the end of the group time as usual. None of them seemed particularly concerned for me or for themselves. I was relieved that they weren't concerned about being there, returning, or that Nick R might be outside. I was curious that none of them, particularly Dan M, seemed concerned about me. I am in a very futuristic building. I don't remember how I got there. Some of the people there had the ability to what seemed to be simply move through the walls or through unusual openings in the walls. They moved me and some others into different areas, like small compartments. We were paired up in no particular order. I was in a compartment with a young woman and we were instructed to take our clothes off. She was a young black woman. She started to dance. All of a sudden they burst in and she was gone. They accused me of being a tease and that I provoked Nick R. They took me to a room where he was recuperating. This wasn't a hospital though. I went into the room to talk to him. There was a lot there but it was so unusual that it may be very difficult to describe. Somehow Nick R and I realized we had both been set up. We talked things out and decided to work together against these people to try to escape and to try to stop their actions against others. They had a, for lack of a better term, futuristic factory. They were either manufacturing people, or rejuvenating live people. One of them was my Aunt A who is still alive but in her 70's. In this factory they had made her look much younger. In one part of this building you could watch them manufacturing body parts to look like certain people. You could watch the body parts coming off an assembly line belt. I was looking for hands that looked like mine. The body parts were all different colors. After they put them altogether the person rolled through giant rollers and were painted a flesh color. In some cases they painted them other colors. In one part of the dream I was painted dark black, not like skin-color black, but a regular black. I was supposed to blend in with other people who worked there. I think I ended up being a kind of marbleized black so I stood out just a little but it didn't cause a problem. As I made my way around the building, I kept getting lost. The building walls were very unusual. In some cases they seemed like colored adobe. In others they seemed to be stainless steel. I now had the ability to move through these walls and strange openings the way others had previously. I didn't see Nick R anymore from here but I knew that he was working in another part of the building trying to foil these people. The factory had been taken over by women and the work they were doing now was only for good.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-05-17),-0.12262205,-0.26069146,-0.38265294,0.25193113
416,"Our cohort was arriving at Sequoia Seminar for the final intensive of our PhD program. I arrived at the dining hall and was saying hello to those already gathered there. I talked to Mary Kay C about the location of our cabins. She told me our cabin was the furthest from the dining hall. I was very concerned about this because I had so much trouble navigating the mountain on our previous trip when our cabins were the closest ones to the dining hall. We were mulling around between the deck and the surrounding grassy area. I saw Jo V and asked her if she had saved me room in her cabin, since we have always been roommates. She said of course she had. When I went to my cabin I realized it was the closest one to the dining hall. I didn't have a key or it was in the cabin so I went back up to borrow Jo V 's key. I went back down again to change before our first meeting. As I was going back and forth all of the other students were standing together for group pictures. Terry K was there, from GC. it did not strike me as odd that he was there. I tried to walk in an area that would not interfere with their pictures. I saw others who were milling around also. I wondered why our cohort was not being included in this group photo. I thought it might be due to the fact that this would be our last intensive. I still thought they should have included us. Now, upon waking, I wonder who the other people milling around were as I know they were not members of my cohort. I finally got into my cabin but it was a very little, about 3 square feet cube with no roof. I reached into an area and got my clothes and was trying to change my clothes without being seen. Melissa J and Bonnie K came up and looked at a note on the door. I started to say that Jo V , Carmen A, and I were in this cabin but they quickly walked away. Then Carmen A came up and said they were looking for me because everyone was waiting for me. I was a bit irritated but said I was trying to hurry and would be there as quickly as possible. As I was changing the group photo finished and I saw some people exercising. They were all doing the same exercises and widely spaced apart. Each person had a partner car. The person was dressed the same color as the car covers. Each car had a colored cover on it but was being driven. The people were moving in conjunction with the cars, as though the cars were directing each move. I thought it looked very interesting, but unusual. I finally arrived back at the meeting room in the conference hall. Everyone was discussing where we were going to meet. Most of them thought we could use that room, but others thought it had already been spoken for. There was some discussion about having to use the meeting areas closest to our cabin block. Most didn't seem up to making the trek from that meeting space to the dining hall three times a day. I went to the kitchen and asked if we could have meals delivered. as we had during our first intensive there. They said they no longer do that. He was trying to give me some explanation that had to do with Mother's day. that was past already. I asked if he could prepare box meals and one of us could drive up the mountain at each meal and pick them up and take them to our meeting space. I think he was saying that he could do that when someone from another cohort interrupted and said they would want the same thing.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-05-17),-0.22972968,-0.03017583,0.11451661,-0.14064643
417,"I was the housekeeper for a man and his young son, similar to the movie Sleepless in Seattle. I had been working for them for nearly a year when they began the search for a new wife for the man. I was in love with him by this time. They found his new wife and I was experiencing the expected feelings about the entire situation, but I did not end my employment there. I did not feel the marriage would work out and I didn't want the man to feel worse when he found himself without a wife or a housekeeper. Shortly after they married, the wife became pregnant with their child. She gave birth to twins. Shortly thereafter she left him but took the twins with her. He was heartbroken and I for him. Within a month or so after she left she returned with the children, but only to leave the children with him to raise. She said she was not ready to raise the children. The man was a fisherman by profession. He had numerous fishing containers setup outside his house. They mostly had wood frames made of 4x4 beams. They were around 4 _ feet tall, 7 feet long and 2 or 3 feet wide. The top ledges were only a few inches wide. I took a bike outside and was riding very fast around the ledges of these various containers. They were all full of water. I don't know if they had different kinds of fish in them or what exactly was in them. The man's mother was concerned for me that I was riding a bike around these ledges, especially since I was riding so fast and turning practically on my side as I made some of the corners. I was somewhat frightened and yet surprised at how confident I felt in my ability to do this successfully. The man gave me a net the size you would use in an indoor aquarium and some ziplock bags. He sent me to one of the containers to begin catching fish. I found I was just as successful using my hand as using the net. All of the fish were about the size of aquarium fish but some larger than others. Some seemed impossible to see, either because they were so thin or because of their coloring. I'm not sure which. Others were larger and blue and white in color. I filled one bag. There was a lot of discussion going on between this man and his parents about this woman and the children. At this point the man was my ex-husband, Darren. When the woman returned with the babies we were in the midst of having a yard sale. Each of the containers now had flat tops covering them and we were sitting things for the yard sale on them. I found boxes of jewelry that I had put away because they were related, primarily, to my marriage to my ex-husband. There were a lot of earrings that were bride & groom and such. There were other earrings that I asked Bev if she would allow Mari Kate S to wear. Bev tried to describe what she would want to wear and what she would be allowed to wear. Jody S was also trying to help clarify for me. Mari Kate S finally came out and was looking through them. I picked up a few pairs and pointed them out to Bev and Jody S. They were some of my favorites from the past that I had been saving, hoping they would come back in style. Kay H brought a number of things out that I loved. Some of it was jewelry but others were knick-knacks I was quite surprised that she didn't tell me to just take the things I wanted. After the yard sale was over we were moving everything back into the garage. Kay H and Darren didn't think I knew how to properly care for the twins, so I let them take care of them and I concentrated on organizing the garage. Ray H had a few shelves in the garage with various glass and plastic items sitting on them. I wanted to put all like items together and move the glass items to the sturdiest shelves. In examining the shelves I realized that one was simply made up of a nylon fabric and resembled a kite. It also had hinges so it could be dropped similar to a drop leaf on a drop-leaf table. I realized it was useless for storage. I went to another shelf that was a huge half-circle that protruded far into the room. I was trying to move some of the furniture and things along the walls so I could move around more easily and get to these shelves more easily. In doing so I nearly knocked quite a few of the glass items to the floor. Actually I think I did knock some of them off but don't recall anything breaking. Near this one unusual shelf was also an unusual metal rack on the wall that was being used to hold glasses and such. This rack rested flat against the wall but hinges allowed different sections to be pulled just far enough away from the wall to allow you to slip an upside down stack of glasses on it. There were quite a few pieces, 100 or more, of one type of blue glassware. Some of them were on this wall rack and others were on the large semi-circular shelf. I was going to put them all on the shelf but then realized that shelf would not support all the weight. I was going to put them all on the rack but then Kay H came out and began telling me how to do that as well. Just for fun, someone suggested some kind of contest involving the number of garage sale items we were each working with. An adult was to represent a child. I was representing Rachel S. I would have won except that I did not get my items counted fast enough, primarily because I had so many more than the others. which is, oddly, what it took to win but you had to have them counted in time too. We are back to dealing with and arguing about the care of the twins. The size of the twins kept changing. they weren't even as big as my hand. At another time, one was nearly the normal size of a newborn and the other was less than the size of my hand. Then they were pieces of paper rather than actual babies, but each baby was two pieces of paper rather than just one. There was some discussion about where the twins would sleep and where Darren and I would sleep. Certainly, I had no desire to share a bed with him as the mother of the twins had done and yet somehow that seemed to be critical to the nocturnal care of the twins. The bed was not a normal bed however. It was more like a sofa with a cot in front of it. We each sat on one end of the sofa and stretched our legs out onto the cot. For some reason it was finally decided that I was to leave and take the twins with me. It is unclear to me if I was to take them permanently or if I was taking them on a purposeful journey. I was to take this journey on horseback, alone with the twins. There was a man helping me to prepare the horse, saddling him and putting the things I would need in the saddlebags, etc. I am traveling on a Native American pilgrimage with Matthew. I have the sense that the purpose of this pilgrimage was primarily for Matthew but somewhere along the way I realized that I was and would continue to derive as much if not more from this journey as he would. We had several things that Matthew had to accomplish on this journey. I believe it was to include two nights out in the woods. There were a number of people on the same journey, so we found we were not alone in figuring out what to do or knowing what we needed to do or how to accomplish those things. I was glad to know this. We became very fond of our fellow travelers. I became more in love with Native American Culture than I had even previously been. The people were wonderful and the traditions and rituals were so rich and wonderful. The rituals were wonderful not just because of the ritual itself but because of the transformation Matthew and I, and others, experienced as a result of completing each ritual. there was something that would be beneficial for Matthew to acquire. Oddly, the only way he could acquire it was to purchase it. It was quite expensive and I realized that neither he nor I could, or should, spend that much money on that item. An elderly Native American man sold it to us for what we told him Matthew had in his bank account which was around $16.99. I felt bad because we lied to him. Matthew had nearly $35 in his account, which was the actual price of the item. I didn't want Matthew to be totally broke so I lied to the man about how much money Matthew had. This struck me as particularly odd because I knew I wouldn't normally do this. When Matthew was writing the check to the man, I made sure he kept hidden the total from his check register. There were several scenes in which the entire group was riding horseback to our next destination or ritual. We were told that for one of the rituals Matthew would need to entirely undress. I knew Matthew would be uncomfortable with this but understood the purpose of the ritual and thought it would be very beneficial. I realized how beneficial it would be for me so I participated in the ritual as well. It was incredibly freeing, as though my soul had been freed. It was exhilarating. I became totally hooked on the entire process and future opportunities. When we settled into our campsite for the night we were preparing meals. I was having a little trouble contemplating eating the food that we were expected to eat. I couldn't bring myself to eat the first thing. The next thing they brought was the foot of some very large animal. It still had the fur on it and everything, but it had been cooked. I cut off two toes. I gave one to someone else and then I ate one. I was surprised that it didn't taste too bad. It seems that I was even eating the fur and didn't mind it. In our next ritual we were given some freedom in how we completed it. Given how great it felt to be able to complete the ritual of being completely nude in front of all these strangers I decided that I would remove most of my clothing and due a Native American dance around the campfire. Everyone admired the progress I made and my new level of confidence. I thought about the twins, thinking something like oh, yes. The twins. I pointed them out or said something about them to the others. Later I thought, wait a minute. I started out with the twins. I can't just not have them in the dream anymore. So I remember thinking something about having them in a type of papoose on my back. We are now sitting in another location talking about future similar, but advanced, journeys we can complete. We would do so in a certain order. To progress to each journey we would need to adequately complete the requirements of the prior and be living a certain lifestyle. At this point I am writing notes on a piece of paper about the things I need to do so I can achieve this level and move on to the next journey. Some of the things this included were writing on a more natural kind of paper and wearing different kinds of jewelry. like more things with feathers and such. There was some type of Native American title that went with the completion of this journey. I can't remember now what it was. It started with a T. Tahoe? Tecumseh? I don't know now. While we are at this place there are also containers sitting around for trash and other things. I was trying to get all the trash into the right container, as I knew that was a perfect example of this new lifestyle. At first another woman or two was somewhat deterring me from what I was attempting. They did not see it as that important. Then someone came around to collect the trash and had a momentary conversation with me about it and I realized that I was right. There were also binders and books sitting around. The speaker was talking about various things we could do to complete the various journeys. She mentioned something about Deepak Chopra. I recall seeing other names. There were other rituals but I don't recall what they were now. I went on a short horseback ride with someone else. There was something sexual about this experience. I was trying to help this other person heighten their sexual awareness or be able to get more pleasure from sexual experiences. On our way home I was riding with a man I had just then met. We clicked immediately and fully.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-05-19),-0.18463725,-0.11019476,-0.18657313,-0.0014504117
419,"I was living on the first floor of Shirley J's old house on Morse Lake. Bev's children came to spend the weekend. Matthew was not there. I was having trouble managing them myself. I was preparing to go on a trip and was going to be taking them with me. It was going to be air travel. I had a 6 am flight. I realized we would need to leave the house about 3:15 am. It was 1 am or so before I got them to bed. I was trying to decide where they were going to sleep. Since Matthew wasn't there I was going to have Andrew S sleep in Matthew's bed and have Rachel S sleep with me. There was another bedroom on this floor. I thought I would have Mari Kate S sleep there. However, I decided, since this was a very large, expensive home, I would take them upstairs and show them the rest of the house. I thought they would enjoy seeing it. As we started upstairs I thought, since Shirley J's bed never gets slept in anymore and it is such a large bed I could have all three of them sleep together in that bed. I'm not sure why I would do that though. We went upstairs. The house has these big wide staircases with red velvet carpeting. We went to Shirley J's bedroom. I opened the door a little bit and noticed a big pile of bed linens on the floor next to the bed. I started to open the door a little more slowly and I noticed someone in there. It turned out that Tom G was sleeping on the floor with a girlfriend.] I woke him up. He sat up and said, What the ___?] I quickly said, Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize anyone was in here. He got up and came out. I said, I come up here every now and then just to check things out and make sure everything is okay. I didn't know you were here. Actually I was trying to come up with a good excuse for being up there. I also couldn't figure out how he got up there without my knowledge. We turned around and walked away. I don't think he followed us. I realized that there was another couple up there, friends of his, in another of the rooms up there. We started to make our way down. The rest of the dream, down the stairs, was a long time. It became a maze of rooms and walkways. Some of the time it was ramps. Sometimes it was escalators. Sometimes the floor actually rolled downwards, so you stepped on it and then just let the floor roll you down to the next level. At each level there was another group of rooms. The rooms were very unique and some had themes. One of them was an Alaskan room. It was pure white, cold, snowy, and icy in the room. There were Eskimos in the room sitting my igloos and fires, wearing white parkas. I think they actually lived there. I had a lot of trouble keeping track of the children, particularly Andrew S and Rachel S, but even Mari Kate S from time to time. I was getting very frustrated with them. I would ask Mari Kate S to help me get Andrew S and Rachel S. Andrew S was playing with Rachel S on a stair rail and she fell off backwards and down several floors. I went crazy. I was screaming and crying. I was afraid to go down and see her, yet I knew I needed to get down there immediately. I knew it was going to be devastating for bed. I didn't see how Rachel S could possibly survive such a fall. I ran down the several flights of stairs only to find Bev standing there holding Rachel S. Bev had tears in her eyes and I could tell she was very upset. She had caught Rachel S, so Rachel S was fine. I didn't even try to explain to Bev what had happened. She didn't look particularly upset with me, but with what happened and what the potential outcome could have been. She didn't seem to want an explanation. I took Rachel S and Bev said something about, yes, you know how I am about my baby. I can't seem to separate myself from her. I'm always worrying about her. I was surprised that Bev was even in town, but she left right after that. Now we were back with Andrew S and Mari Kate S and we were back to working our way down these various levels of floors.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-05-24),-0.16335304,-0.10342936,0.034052942,-0.04522664
424,"I had lunch in the mall with my CRHP sisters and Sue P. Sue P said Vince P hasn't been well and hasn't been around much, maybe not in town much. I wondered if this is why he has not returned my calls lately. Sue P had black and yellow hair braids attached to her hair. We all sat at round tables with 3-4 people per table. We were at Keystone at the Crossing Mall. When I left the mall I couldn't find my car. It was near Christmas time. There was snow on the ground and it was very cold. I went into another restaurant, which you could enter from the parking lot, to warm up. Bill C. was there alone, sitting in a booth. I joined him and he told me he was waiting on another couple that he was going to be dining with. We chatted until they arrived. They all invited me to stay and then Bill C could drive me around to find my car. When we got ready to go he needed to use the restroom. He went down this long hall and was waiting for someone to come out. He was wearing a long beige sweater, similar to one I own. His had large patches of brown leather on it. We were driving around looking for my car. We were talking about Christmas and that he still needed to do some Christmas shopping with just a few days left. I recall talking about his family and some other things. He told me that I needed to lose weight. I could tell there was some chemistry between us. I don't recall if we found my car or not. Before I got out of his car he leaned over and kissed me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-05-27),-0.30697766,-0.04188942,-0.17771387,0.020127777
427,"I was staying either visiting or living at Morse Lake with friends. Someone was banging on the door. It sounded like they were using chains. We tried to ignore them because we didn't know who it could be and we were somewhat afraid to let them in. We finally could no longer ignore them so we went to the door. It turned out that their boat was sinking into the lake and their baby was still in it. I was aghast at how they could allow something like this to happen, that they were all safely out but their infant baby was still buckled in. I yelled at my friends to follow me and instructed them to lean over one side of the dock and push with their hands down on the end of the boat that was still above water. It raised the other end of the boat far enough that I could rescue the baby. I dried and nurtured the baby. I was hesitant to give him back to the parents. They didn't seem very concerned. The baby's name was Robert. I began calling him Robbie. The parents hesitantly took the baby back and they all left. A few hours later they returned and left the baby. I raised Robbie for a few years. His parents came back and took him back until he was an adult. A few years later, a group of people began blowing up houses that sat on Morse Lake. We were watching from inside the house, yet it was as though we had an aerial view of the lake and could see the top of each home as it was blown up. We kept being thankful that they didn't get to close to us. Finally, however, that did get to us and they blew up our house. None of us were hurt, but landed in the lake with a piece of our house, about the size of an average size boat. We all climbed on top of this piece. It was flat and somewhat oval in shape. It had carved poles coming up with another flat piece of wood on the other end of the poles. This gave us shelter over our head. There were four adults including myself and two adult male children. both mine. These two children were named Greg and Charlie and I simply adored them. They were my life. During the entire dream I was attending to my children, to keep them near me and make sure they were safe. As we were floating in the lake, we saw Robbie. alone. He floated over to us and got on our raft with us. I was so ecstatic to see him. He said he and his parents had split long ago. I asked why he hadn't come back home to me and he said he wasn't sure that he was welcome. I fussed over him quite a bit at that point, but trying to be careful not to make the others jealous or to question if I loved Robbie more. I simply felt so bad for Robbie and the life he had. I considered him my own son. Another of my son's found us and joined us as well. I don't know how many of these boys were my biological children or if they were my children the same way Robbie was. I can't remember the name of the fourth one. He is the one that felt most unloved and left out. I tried often to reassure him because all four of my boys were all equally important to me. We decided we needed to take pieces of the wood and paddle down the lake to another town for refuge. As we paddled the lake became more and more crowded with other families in the same situation. Some were actually in boats, but most were on pieces of wood from their homes. As we continued down the lake it became a river and became very narrow. At points the river was bordered in wood. We had to navigate through these sharp turns that were much smaller than our raft. Somehow our raft seemed to lift right above the wood barriers and carry itself over to clear water. We ran into several similar situations. As we navigated along, we saw many people stranded on the shore and frightened. We decided there was room for more people on our raft so we pulled along the shore and allowed more people to join us. At one we came to a fork in the river. If we continued straight ahead, we could see another town that was being destroyed. At the end of the left fork we saw a carnival. We somehow maneuvered our raft over the grass island and headed down the left fork of the river towards the carnival. As we neared the carnival we saw that it was also being destroyed. We found another fork and veered off in that direction. We finally found peaceful waters with homes on either side of us and no sign of danger. However, there were many things floating around us. These things, as best I can describe them, looked like floating counters with stools, such as you would see in a diner. There was a woman behind the counter of one. It looked as though there were enough seats for everyone on our raft so we asked her if we could come aboard. We were all hungry and thirsty, as we had been afloat now for many hours. This had begun at dusk and it was now way beyond dawn of the next day. She didn't seem to want us there, as she didn't want us to take up all of her seats. There were many others with more seats and no people so we went to another.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-01),-0.26505038,-0.18050392,-0.046257753,0.21571404
428,"I was living at my birth home. My father was the man who is the father in the TV show State of Grace. He was a very kind, loving, compassionate father. He had some health problem and was required to rest and not be too active. It seems as though he was in the hospital. I brought in a deck of cards and I moved his tray close to him so he wouldn't have to stretch or move too much to play. There were four of us playing. I commented once that I didn't like the playing cards we were using because the symbols were too confusing. At least for me, I added. The others didn't seem to have a problem. We were each supposed to have three cards in our hand at all times. When it was our turn, we would lay one card down and then draw another from the stack. I have no idea what the game was. I realized I had a lot more than three cards in my hand. At this point it seemed that we were at home and Daddy was standing behind me. He told me to turn my cards face down and he would take the extras away. He took quite a few. I showed him there were still way too many, so he took more. I was wearing my purple sleep shirt and I walked outside on the back sidewalk. Daddy came up behind me and hugged me. I was crying. He wanted to know what was wrong. I told him how frustrated I am because I try so hard to lose weight and to get my sleep schedule under control and I continue to be unsuccessful. I told him I need help but I don't know who can help me or how.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-02),-0.1901663,-0.028080024,-0.16769545,-0.008575603
429,"I was a member of the family on the TV show Seventh Heaven. It seemed to take place, in a way, over a period of several years. I was one of the children. I was the one that seemed to be particularly close to the father. It seemed that the mother of this family was in some way abusive of the children. Not physically abusive and not sexually abusive. She neglected them and was abusive in how she punished them. We were in the attic of the home and it was very similar to the attic of my birth home. There was a regular staircase that led to the attic. The whole thing was hardwood floor, not finished. You could walk through the middle but towards the walls you couldn't stand upright as the roof angled down. The attic was used for storage. Myself and two of the younger siblings were up there. I get the feeling that we were up there because we were being punished. We started organizing the stuff up there but I'm not sure why. In one section of the attic there were a bunch of boxes of blankets. There was a pole. The pole held hangers with blankets folded over them. Mother came up into the attic. I don't know if she was particularly angry. We were explaining to her what we were doing. On one end of the attic there were a bunch of very long narrow boxes leaning up against the wall. They were really dirty and had cobwebs on them. I kind of pulled one of them over a little to see what was in them. It was curtain rods. I was going to move them to the other end of the attic. As we had been organizing things we were moving them down to the other end of the attic. Then I started second-guessing the way I was moving everything down to the other end. I wondered if maybe that wasn't the best way to organize things up there. Maybe I should categorize things but not bunch it all together so much. Maybe leave it spread out more. I was going to do something with all of those blankets. The father came up now also. This is the first time that he got a sense that the mother was mistreating the children. I think eventually both parents went back downstairs and left us up there. The parents were hosting a party. The mother was starting to act towards the guest the way she normally does towards her children. She was also treating her children, in front of her guests, the way she normally treats them when there is no one else around. People were becoming very concerned about her treatment of the children. Her behavior became worse and worse. She was eventually committed to a mental rehab facility. The father was extremely distraught over this. Not over the fact, so much, that she had been committed and he was now a single parent, but rather that he had just learned what she had been doing to his children and he was distraught over the treatment of the children as well. It was especially difficult for everyone when she was getting ready to leave. She was walking slowly around the house looking at anything. She was feeling very sad but not necessarily remorseful. I don't think her feelings were associated with the fact that she was being told to leave but just the fact that she was leaving. There were no feelings of remorse. The father was staying away from her purposefully. I can't recall if he even spoke to her or embrace her before she left. It doesn't seem as though he did. Sometime later, she came back for a day visit. He didn't want to see her at all. He was still very distraught over the abuse. I get the sense that he was not going to be able to forgive her for this. Of course, in the TV show he is a minister and is very forgiving. The mother in the waking life show is not at all as she is depicted. Nonetheless, he is still really struggling with this because it is his own children. This next part seems to be a few years later. The children are coming home for a Christmas celebration. A couple of the older children are married and have children of their own now. The youngest child, Ruthie, is a little bit older now. Somewhere Ruthie and Simon were creating a big sign but I can't remember now what it was about. When everyone was there for this celebration. I had said earlier that I felt as though I was the child that was closest to the father. Several times during the dream, when I approached the father to offer comfort, I was the one that was always asking him if he was okay and hugging him often, sitting with him, when I could tell that he was especially distraught. The mother returned and she wanted to return to live there. She was knocking at a double door, trying to get in. I had my body against the area where the two doors meet to try to prevent her from getting in while the others asked the father what to do. He finally said we should let her in. When we opened the door we realized she was moving back in because the double doors led into the garage and we saw the garage piled full of all of her things. She was very frazzled and dirty looking, as were all of her boxes of possessions. As we were moving her in, there were rolls of carpeting. They were small enough that we could just pick them up and throw them over our shoulder to carry them. We realized while we were doing this and talking to her that she had remarried after she left, even though she had never gotten a divorce from my father. She was pregnant with her new husband's child. She was leaving him.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-16),-0.14162286,-0.09398186,0.17292278,0.009785118
431,"Kay H was at my house. I believe it was my birth home. We were in the kitchen preparing a meal. I was expecting a blind date. I was fixing fish and pasta for my date, Matthew, and myself. We fixed Kay H some hot dogs. I got into the lunch meat drawer of the refrigerator. I asked Kay H why she has always hated me so much. She said she was concerned about Darren and Matthew. She went into the other room. I told Matthew, who is 5-6 years old, to take Kay H's hot dogs to her. We went ahead and ate because my date was late and I thought he might be standing me up. After we ate I went into my bedroom. I sat on the bed and tried to call him. I don't know if I couldn't remember the number, if I was misdialing, or if I was just having trouble getting connected. I got the wrong number several times. Suddenly, he came bounding into the room and plopped onto the bed, lying on his side, propping up his head with one hand, elbow resting on the bed. This seemed to be perfectly natural for him, even though we had never met before. We introduced ourselves. He apologized for being late. It was due to his work. He has a job working with young people. This causes him to have a hectic schedule. He says this has prevented him from having a lasting relationship. that most women can't deal with it. He says that if I want to be with him I will have to accept that. He and I were in a car. I had to return a wig to some thugs. He was concerned about me. He suggested we not get out of the car or stop the car. As we drove by the thug's car, we just threw the wig out our car window and into their car window. We went back to the house. My parents show up. I went to change clothes. When I came out there was a wall of bright pink chiffon curtains that were periodically gathered together in a rosebud fashion. They were at the top of very wide, white steps. When I got to the bottom of the steps there was a wall of bright yellow chiffon curtains, again followed by a set of wide, steps. This was repeated 2-3 more times. This man and myself were fighting off a group of thugs. We were doing pretty well holding our own at first. But then we both got picked up and thrown into a wooden wall/fence that resembled a wood plank fence. It was solid like a wall, however and none of it broke when our bodies slammed into it.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-17),-0.18568696,-0.1690811,-0.33902067,-0.015764676
435,"I was bodily flying around the houses of my CRHP sisters who live in Foxtown. I was opening their shutters and curtains or draperies from the outside of the house. I was singing this song about letting the sunshine in. When I was outside of BJ's house, I knew she was in the shower but I still opened the curtains to her bedroom windows. I thought that might be a problem but I. it might have just been a split second that she was in the shower or bedroom. But I did it anyway. Like she will see it on time and it won't be a problem. There were a couple of them that I wasn't sure if I had the right house but I did it anyway. Later, BJ asked me about it. If I was the one that did it. Then I didn't want to admit that I did it. that I opened her bedroom curtains. I said, Yes. I opened some of them. That was a lie. Part of this started because I knew that Julie D was upset or depressed so I wanted to open her windows and let the sunshine in. I thought that would help her over her depression. Some time after that I went to Julie D's house and encouraged her to get out. I told her I would watch her kids for her for awhile so she could get out and do something on her own. She had two little girls and a little boy. I was somewhat concerned about the boy but I still wanted her to get out and do something on her own so I went ahead and watched all three of them. I took the kids to the beach but there was no more of that in the dream. I was bringing the kids home from the beach. Julie D and Mike D were there. The kids were talking about what a good time they had except for the extreme heat. We mentioned that perhaps the next time we needed to do something about the heat. I suggested that perhaps a beach umbrella was a good solution. They thought too that was a good solution, but they didn't know if their dad would buy one. I asked, Why? How much are they? They said, maybe as much as $100. These are small children so I don't know why or how they would even know that. I said, Well, if we could find one for about $60, if he wouldn't pay for it maybe I would. They were hesitant to even ask him. I thought it was odd because they have this really nice new home in Foxtown. They drive very nice vehicles. They have a boat. Yet, the kids are worried that he wouldn't pay $60 for a beach umbrella for his children? It just didn't make sense to me so I decided to mention it to him. While we were talking to them about what a good time we had I said, Maybe next time we should have a beach umbrella. I understand you can probably get one for under $100. I think maybe we found one. I think maybe he mentioned like a Service Catalog. He said there was one for $61. I still wasn't sure if he was going to pay for it. He said we could order it out of that catalog. But I still wasn't sure if he was going to pay for it or if he expected me to pay them for ordering it out of their catalog. I think this was another time that I had gone to their house. Julie D and the kids had just snuck something in the house and they didn't want me to see it. Later I found out that they had bought something for me. It was two things that kind of looked like the cement birdbaths that people buy for their yards. They were that shape but they weren't nearly that heavy. One of them had elephants and things in the part that would be a birdbath but was unfinished. The other one had a brown and green glaze finish. It had something else in it but I don't remember what. Julie D told me to take it home with me but to act as though I had not seen the one with the elephants because the kids didn't want me to see that one yet.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-22),-0.23926532,-0.21064252,0.13256775,-0.18343282
436,"I was floating along the top of this lake. I was in a vertical position. I don't have the sense that anything was propelling me but I was moving pretty rapidly along the top of this river. I was floating along the top of the water but near the water's edge. Occasionally there were different alligators and things in the water. That may have been the reason that I was going fast or. It seems more that I occasionally I had to go up higher so as to be out of their reach. I was in these woods. Someone helped me to build a cabin. It was our intent to build a very inexpensive cabin. This was partially because I wanted to live in the woods. We didn't build it well, at all. The windows didn't fit properly. We had a huge rainstorm and we couldn't keep the rain from coming in around the windows. I was watching a basketball game on TV. It was a championship game between an Illinois school and a University in my home state. The Illinois team won. After the game they were interviewing the coach. The coach was Ben D. I was very excited about this. I decided to go outside and wait for him to come out so I could talk to him. When he finally came out there were mobs of people all over. I ran up behind him and put my arms around him and kissed him on the check. He turned around and kissed me lightly on the lips. He was surprised to see me there. I told him I was also surprised to see him. I told him I have a cabin here because I wanted a small place out in the country. I wanted him to stay and chat but he said he couldn't because he still had to get back to Illinois and he still had press people to talk to and had a game the next day. I said something about the next time he would be in my home state. One of the athletes had been injured in a car accident or something some time ago and had lost both of his legs. His father wouldn't take pity on him and made him keep working on what he really wanted to do. So the athlete kept working at playing basketball, even though he didn't have any legs. He didn't do it from a wheelchair either. He was simply using his hands to move himself around. He was playing in this game. He was a hero to people because he overcame this shortcoming.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-23),-0.0755848,-0.20203502,-0.001688098,0.19735268
438,"Matthew, Ashley B and I had gone to BJ's house for a family picnic. She had invited a lot of the Harris family. Richard K also showed up just as I was leaving. Someone else, and I said, oh, both Richards are here. While we were there she had three live turkeys running around in the house and other birds flying around in the house and sitting on the tables and eating the food. It didn't seem to bother anyone but me. When I got there Kim H had asked me to fix her watch for her. I sat down at BJ's sewing machine to fix it for her. BJ wanted to know what I was doing. I told her. She said, Oh well, isn't that just perfect! Kim H can't ask me to fix it for her. She has to ask you to fix it for her. Sarcastically. I said, I don't know what the deal is. You and Kim H really need to work things out. She asked me to fix her watch and I just said I would do it for her. BJ said, are there holes in the stitching in the seams. I said that I didn't see any. She said, Well let me see it. So I held it up and showed it to her and she couldn't find any either. That seemed to upset her even more. Then she started in on me my about her kids liking me best. She was going on about all the things that she was mad about. She was being very mean. I finally said, Look, I'm just going to go home. I don't deserve this. I'm just trying to be nice to your kids. I don't know what your problem is with them or with me. But I don't deserve this and I'm just going to go home. The more this went on the angrier I became. I became beside myself with anger. Even when I awoke I still felt the anger. BJ just had a huge chip on her shoulder about something. Especially regarding Kim H and I just wish they could work it out. I went and wanted to find Bev and at least say hello to her before I left. I saw Bill F and was looking for Matthew so I could go home. Bill F told me where he was so I asked him to take me over there. We headed to the car to go get Matthew. As soon as we got there Matthew showed up and I told him we were leaving. He didn't want to leave right away. I told him what happened and then he was okay to go. I went upstairs where everyone was eating and I very quietly said hello to Bev and told her very, very briefly what happened and that I was very angry and uncomfortable so I was just going back home. Some people were just looking at me and wondering what was going on and I just wasn't going to get into it. I went downstairs and I was going to use the bathroom before I left and Mother knocked on the door and asked me if I wouldn't consider staying. She wanted to know what was really going on. I said, Mother I can't hear you right now. I finally said, I don't know what's going on with her but I don't deserve for her to talk to me the way she did when I was just trying to help her child. The bathroom morphed into this very large room, not like a bathroom, but I was still using the bathroom. All these people kept coming in and I kept saying, Can't I have a little privacy here? Can you not wait until I finish using the bathroom? Bill F and Matthew came in to give me something and kept their eyes averted. Brian F was sitting on a sofa next to me and somebody was sitting on the floor in front of me. I said, Look, I don't even have any clothes on. Can someone at least hand me some clothes so I can put some clothes on? Someone handed me a new white T-shirt with some words or something on it. I thought to myself that it wouldn't be very good because they would be able to see right through it. I went ahead and put it on. We had to go upstairs and find Ashley B. I asked Bev if she had met Ashley B and she said, no, who is Ashley B? I introduced them. Ashley B was sitting at a table and BJ was close by and Ashley B said, Can't I stay? I wasn't the bad girl. I looked at her kind of angrily and thought, Oh. Are you implying that I was the bad girl? That kind of upset me. Since it was Ashley B I was trying to be nice about it. We finally got out to the car. I was getting my things out of the front seat so Ashley B could sit in the front seat with Matthew. Suddenly we were driving and Ashley B was in the backseat and I was in the front. I said, No Matthew, pull over. I want Ashley B to be able sit in the front seat with you. She said something kind of sarcastic. I thought that was not necessary. uncalled for. We got out and switched. I got into the backseat. There were some suitcases sitting on the seat and other things. I don't know why all that was there. We took off again. Now Richard K was in the front seat also and there were BJ, Ashley B, and one small child were all in the front seat. We were going to take BJ back to her house. I was looking out the window. There was a child, approximately 5-6 years of age, heading into the house. He looked so familiar. I thought, I'll bet he's from the city where I live. I think I must know him from the apartment community. Now he is in the car with us, getting something from BJ.

440,"I was a contestant on a dating show. I was competing with 10-12 other women, ages 16 and 46. I was the 46-year-old. Ben D was there. There were three shower rooms. Two of them each had two showers and the other had just one shower. There were rooms that had just beds. The room was the length of the bed and not much wider. The shower rooms were the same size. Two of the bedrooms each had two beds and one had just one. One room for an employee was a bigger room but not much in it. It did have a shower in there and the door locked. At the top of the door was an open space, kind of like they used to have in old houses/buildings. We each created some kind of artwork on a piece of paper the size of a flipchart. I was being taunted. I violently lost my temper and destroyed someone's artwork. Four finalists were chosen to be contestants for the next year. It was one overnight. Most of the overnight bags, including my own, were the size of a regular handbag. I had to sleep in one of the large living areas as the beds were all taken already. The next day I wanted to take a shower either in the room with only one shower or take my shower in one of the other rooms when no one else was in there. I couldn't manage either one. I then went into the employee room and decided to use that shower. Other people were trying to get in. They didn't think I should be using that room. There was an entry hallway. In the hallway was a bar, like in a clothes closet. All the contestants had their formal gowns hanging there. I was one of the finalists for the next year. I was talking to the other finalists about our gowns for next year. Ben D kind of came to my rescue when the other contestants and some other men were being critical of me, etc. He expressed a romantic interest and told me he was going to take me away so I wouldn't have to worry about any of it.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-27),-0.14591098,-0.1217673,0.14562815,-0.23063086
441,"I was at my townhouse. I had to take everything from my patio indoors as the maintenance people were getting ready to poor new cement. My neighbors to my right had already cleared their patio, as they were the next ones to be completed. I looked through their gate and wondered where they had put everything, as they had a very large outdoor grill and large outdoor patio furniture, not to mention the many other things they had out their. I noticed the wood frame for the new cement had already been laid and their flowerbeds were full of overgrown weeds, as they do not plant flowers or care for them in any way. I began to carry the things from my patio into my dining room. The dining room of my townhouse was wider than in waking life. The neighbors to my left came out and began helping me to clear my patio. We discussed that the three families help each other clear and return things from each patio, as it is our turn to do so. I said that was a great idea. I realized that the neighbors on either side of me had become good friends when I knew the one family by little more than name and the other family not even by name. They were both black families. In waking life only one is black. As I was carrying things into my dining room I was surprised at how many things I had out there. I suppose I had taken things out there little by little over the last five years and didn't realize how much had accrued. I even had two floor lamps. I found that the cord on one had split completely apart and the two halves were no longer connected to each other at all. I was disappointed and frustrated but realized that I could get what I need at the hardware store and fix it as I had done with two of my indoor floor lamps. I had hung pictures and things on the wood fence. This next thing is difficult to describe. There were two things, the size of one of my flowerbeds, which had words on them. They were kind of like paper posters, but they had been lying on that flowerbed with other things sitting on them. One of them was a copy of a custom-made area rug. It had religious quotes on it and religious pictures. I had forgotten how beautiful it was I thought those quotes were very appropriate for me right now and that I should put them on something else so I can see them everyday. As we were doing this the neighbors to my right, still don't know their name, had built a very large wooden enclosure for their large black dog. I commented to them that their dog never seemed to care much for my rabbit, Sir Gallahad. I said he used to bark at him a lot. For that matter, he tends to bark when I'm out there also, but that does seem to have lessened. I'm not sure why they had built this enclosure. Maybe to be able to let him be outdoors when they are not home. Our shared fence had a gate in it, which allowed us to access each other's patios. As I was clearing my patio they moved the dog enclosure to my patio. I wasn't sure why. I had the impression that they did it because I had more room now and they wanted more room on their own patio. This enclosure was about 4 feet tall and approximate 7 x 7 feet square. Their dog stands about 3+ feet tall. At first the enclosure had a top on it but later it did not. While they were helping me to clear my patio they took some of the larger things and stored them in another wooden enclosure on their patio for me. We both acknowledged that it would only be for a few days anyway. I was a bit concerned about how they were putting some things in there. I was concerned that something might break. However, I was grateful for the assistance so I didn't say anything. when no one was around and the patio was almost empty I went to one corner of the patio, in a flowerbed, and urinated. I thought, This is cool that I can do this without any concern of being seen. It seems that I may have done this twice. I asked the neighbors how long they planned to leave the dog enclosure on my patio so they moved it back to their patio. Now it was smaller in width and length. As we looked down into the enclosure, the dog was in there. They also had several pink rose bushes. Someone else came up and cut the largest flowers off the rose bushes. They said that now the enclosure was fine to leave the dog in there while they were away. It was dark now, and I was standing out on the patio. I still had three lights out there. I think two of them might be fixtures that needed to be taken indoors and were not in their usual spot. I was thinking about how much I liked the effects of those lights and wondering why I don't take more time to enjoy that space that I have worked so hard on for the last five years.

444,"Several times I thought I was trying to wake up and trying to get Matthew to help me wake up. I felt I was napping too long but I was in too deep asleep to wake myself up. I tried to call to Matthew, Help me. Help me. Help me wake up. But I couldn't get anything out. I tried to roll over and was paralyzed and this frightened me. I thought to myself, This shouldn't frighten you because you know what it is and you tell other people about it. Still, it was frightening. I wanted to roll over to my side. I finally was able to do so. Then I thought I had somehow made it to my bedroom door, though I was lying on the floor. I was still trying to call for Matthew to help me wake up. I was trying to hit the door and/or the doorframe to get his attention. I thought I was moving my arms but I don't know if I was actually hitting the door or not. Whatever was happening wasn't working. I was not getting Matthew's attention and he was not helping me. I thought I had been asleep way too long and wanted to wake up. I didn't want to waste so much of my day off and I had a lot I wanted to do today. Still, I was in a very deep sleep and couldn't seem to wake myself up. I'm not sure if I looked at the clock 2-3 times in my dream or actually woke up enough to look at the clock in waking life. I had the sense that I had been asleep for about four hours. When I lay down to take a nap I was only going to nap for about a half-hour.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-29),-0.0024750934,-0.32303756,-0.07361212,0.2762245
445,"I seemed to be in a learning environment, albeit a very unusual one. In this setting, each person was in an individual carrier of sorts. Perhaps something like a boat. However, we were evenly spaced apart and moving at the same rate of speed in two separate directions. The closest thing I can relate it to is an amusement park water ride. I don't even recall the purpose or what we were doing there. Whatever it was, I recognized that I was afraid to make the high jump down into the water, now without my carrier. There was a man below me in the water and he was throwing things up into the air and I was catching them and putting them into a compartment above and behind me. I was particularly interested in this man until I caught one thing in particular. When I caught this rocket-looking, blue and white item I thought it was a sign that we were meant to be together. However, when he realized that I had caught it, he instructed me to give it to his mother, that it was intended for her. Later something similar happened, I believe I was below and he was above and caught a bead necklace that I had thrown, and he then realized that we were meant to be together. Our places reversed again and I was catching nearly every necklace he threw upwards. Later we were on a beach. We were in training for something. We had to pass our training to be able to do whatever it is we were applying for. Something happened that we realized that we needed to hide from a group of people. There were very large orange flowers all over the beach. At will, accepted members of our group had the ability to turn them into beach umbrellas for camouflage. They did so until the danger had passed and then they turned the umbrellas back into flowers. I thought this was very cool because I realized that I would soon be able to do that- when I completed my training. Because of my connection to this man I had no doubt that I would be accepted. We ended up getting married.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-29),-0.1160537,-0.18347086,-0.057419352,-0.0048037013
446,"Staying in a hotel by the ocean in a bad part of town. I was there with Matthew. We were talking about me looking for a job and what we could do and things such as this. I thought it was a dream and then said, Oh, it's not a dream. This is great. It was not a very safe part of town. I wanted Matthew to be very careful. It was the type of hotel that people normally live in for short periods of time. They had kitchens, sitting rooms, etc. I decided to go out but I don't recall why. Once I got outside I wasn't sure which direction to head so I just started walking. A Young mother with a baby in stroller and another child passed me. I decided to stop her and ask her for directions. She directed me to walk up this steep hill and reminded me that this was not the safest part of town and that I should be careful. As I was walking up this steep hill I came to a church. It was very interesting looking. Nothing at all like any church I've ever seen nor would I have imagined it to be a church. I went up the three flights of stairs to the entry. The entry was a small square opening. In waking life no one, not even a child, could fit through it. Yet, somehow I entered through that small square opening. There was a reception or something going on in the church. I met Robin Williams and his wife. They were an elderly couple. We hit it off and they invited me to come home with them. I did so and called Matthew. He joined us there. Robin was very distraught. I think they were both tired of living. They want to die. They tried to kill themselves along with two children in a small square pool inside their hotel room. I found them in time to save them. They were not pleased, as they really wanted to die. There was something else about going through personnel files in an office.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-29),-0.003714875,-0.2296761,0.05868751,0.07301694
448,"Suggested to Matthew that we help each other wash our cars at home. I washed my interior, vinyl seats, the same way I would the outside. I had to rub hard to remove old, white streaks. Driving south on B1 Blvd. Very small black male child on bike road out in front of me and crossed Blvd. I was very concerned about him getting hit. I made a right turn in front of oncoming traffic. I would have had plenty of room/time except that I couldn't get my car to go for a few seconds after I made the turn. I was nearly hit and the cars that almost hit me were angry that I pulled out in front of them. My car power could be switched from peddle/bicycle power to engine. As I was headed south on B1 there was another black male child, adolescent, riding a bike. It had a platform on the cross bar and seat because he couldn't reach the peddles. His dad had fixed it so he could ride it this way. He sat on this platform and rested his feet on it. Crowd of people connected hands to feet, lowering each other down into this box.

449,"I was working at the SXDS Regional office because there was a district manager's meeting. All the district manager's were in town and were staying at what seems to be a hotel. Gary S was there. Gary S was sitting to my left at a table for four. We were innocently bumping each other's feet and such. he reached under and touched my knee. A little bit later I reached under the table and rubbed his thigh. We knew were going to end up getting together that night, as soon as we would have a chance to be alone. Doctor C was there too, kind of in and out. I have no idea what he was doing there or what that was about. The place that the district manager's were staying, Gary S' anyway, was part of my house. When he came in, he was surprised at the changes that I had made in my living room. The house was unlike anywhere I have lived in waking live. It was kind of similar to my living room now, but it was larger. It was almost large enough for two living rooms, because I had several sofas in there and different things.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-07-09),-0.21357189,-0.06596843,-0.10827841,-0.047228478
450,"This started out very pleasant but turned ugly. I went to visit Ben D at his home but it was in RI. Matthew went along. Matthew's behavior was very atypical and embarrassing. Ben D was put-off, for lack of a better word, at his behavior. Matthew kept trying to rush me to go home because he wanted to see Ashley B and go out with his friends. At times some of Ben D's students were present, as was his mother. Our behavior was in check whenever these people were present. Whenever we were alone he was very loving and attentive, expressing his desire to make love with me. Ben D had my weekly dream group publicized in a campus newsletter. One week I had a dozen or more of his students arrive unannounced for the group. Part way into the group I noticed that Dan M, Lou S, and Mark M had left. Samuel K was also present as a special guest speaker. I was telling the group about the recent SAID conference in Boston and Samuel K's costume as a Safari Hunter, with a stuffed, pink, elephant pinned to the back of his shirt. As I was conducting the group I realized it is July and my Christmas tree is still up. I looked at Matthew and said, I just realized it is July and our Christmas tree is still up. I was debating whether or not to even take it down at this point or to just leave it until Christmas this year. Many of the students said they hoped to be back the next week. I asked if anyone had see Lou S, Dan M, and Mark leave and someone said they had. She said they hadn't made eye contact however. After group ended I was in a car with three other people who had been in attendance. One of them was Carlton W. We were discussing why Lou S, Dan M, and Mark might have gotten up and left. I followed up with one of them and they said they left because they weren't sure they were comfortable with so many new people joining us.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-07-09),-0.07652761,-0.10208918,-0.21236886,-0.04699341
451,"I'm at something like a stadium. Two women, celebrities, were in a battle for control of something, though not a physical battle. Everyone was in danger and trying to escape. Ben D seemed to be a primary target but refused to leave without me. we did get separated because she had spotted him and he needed to get away as quickly as possible. Others and I were yelling at him to run. Later I learned that he had been killed. I was very sad. I continued trying to escape from this stadium. Sometimes I found myself retracing my steps. I disconnected all the electrical sources for the kitchen area, as that is where she was holed up. I realized that two other women were trying to help her. They and two other men were sitting at this huge metal table that was on tracks. I electrically sabotaged the table and it crashed when they could not stop it. They ended up being killed with two innocent people as a result of my action. I felt bad but not guilty because I believed that I had saved many more people in the process. I wouldn't believe that Ben D had been killed. It seems that later I found out that he had in fact survived. I just needed to find him, to get to him. One of my efforts to escape was to hide in an upside down trashcan. The trashcan was clear plastic but the various trash bags in it were black. I had one of two men turn the trashcan upside down over my head and hide me on one side of it with the trash bags on the other side. This way I was hidden from view at some angles. They began to roll four trashcans to another area. I was in one of those and I was praying no one would see them from the angle where I was visible. I was lying somewhere asleep. I tried to wake up. I partially opened my eyes and thought I was truly awake. Things seemed still and quiet. I thought I was awake and that this whole thing had really happened. Then I realized that it wasn't over and the safest thing for me to do probably was to go back to sleep, or at least pretend to be asleep or dead. I was so drowsy that I couldn't keep my eyes open anyway. Someone came and got me and told me they had a safe way out for me. I went with them. They had me hidden and were rushing me by all of these other people. I asked if I could talk to them but they didn't respond. I was feeling a strong need to talk to someone as I had been going through this ordeal alone.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-07-09),-0.22061694,-0.2833478,0.012140974,0.27664077
453,"I went to visit Mother and Daddy. The house was different than their house in waking life. They had sold that house and moved into a retirement community where they had their own apartment or condo. It was very small. It seems that Mother was spending most of her time in bed. There was a little table by the bed and Daddy would sit in the room and read. You could see the front door from there. There was a little kitchenette off that room. It seems that was all there was to it. It was a very steep windy road leading up to their apartment. It was one lane. When I was getting ready to leave, I think Bev was in the car with me at that point, I had a string around the steering wheel. I was trying to steer using that string rather than putting my hands on the wheel. I was in someone's way and I had to maneuver the car around and in doing so I lost control a couple of times but we did not get into an accident and no one was injured. I didn't do any damage to anyone's property. Bev finally said, You don't have any control with that string. You have to hold the steering wheel. There was something to do with a cake. Maybe a wedding cake or an anniversary cake. It was chocolate. When I was in their apartment I was going to put that cake away. One of them said something about me taking some of it home so I put some of it in a separate container for me to take home. After I left, the car I was driving turned into something more like a skateboard except that it was larger. I could sit on it. It seems that Matthew was on it with me. A couple of times we missed our turn and we had to backtrack. Once we had to stop at someone's house and ask for directions. It almost feels as though we were in a race.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-07-14),-0.18093725,-0.21776524,0.13972622,0.33379248
458,"I was struggling with whether or not I was awake. I thought I was sitting up on the side of the bed. I had my hands over my eyes or my ears. I decided that I was awake now, but I couldn't wake up fully. I heard noises downstairs and it scared me because I knew Matthew wasn't supposed to be home at that time. He was out of town. I managed to get myself to the bedroom door and get my door shut and locked. Then I thought I was fully awake so I opened the door a little bit and I realized that Matthew had come home and had just gone into the bathroom. I went and banged on the door but he was in the shower and didn't hear me. I went back into my bedroom and closed the door. I came back out later and saw him and I was furious with him for frightening him. I was yelling at him not to do that to me. that he had scared me because I wasn't expecting him home and then I hear these noises in the house and didn't know what was going on. I was ranting about it to him. This is uncharacteristic of me in waking life. I think he and Ashley B and another of their friends were getting ready to go back out. They were downstairs. I was taking empty boxes and throwing them as hard as I could downstairs. I was trying to get them to bang against the door or the wall at the bottom of the stairs so he would know just how angry I was. This time I wasn't angry because he had come home without telling me and frightened me. This time I was angry with him for leaving again, because he is never home, because the summer break is almost over and I feel as though I haven't seen him much during his break. I am very happy that he and Ashley B have found each other and are so happy together, but that has definitely taken time away from me. so that is difficult for me. It makes me feel as though I missed out on having the summer with him. There was a part of the dream where I was cleaning up the apartment and I had cleaned out my bedroom and was now working on my office. In the office there were a couple of piles of gifts that were wrapped and waiting for people. One pile was Matthew's birthday presents. Another pile was old Christmas presents that had not been delivered. I had been saving them for when I saw these people and I finally decided when I was cleaning up the room to just forget it. I didn't even remember what was in each one. I unwrapped them. I found a couple of sweaters. I thought they were nice, and realized that they were my size, so I decided to keep them for myself. Matthew was there at his current age and simultaneously at the age of 8 or 9. He came in with his bike helmet on. I knew that the older Matthew was cleaning out his room. I told the younger Matthew to check with the older Matthew to see if you need a new bike helmet. You could have the one he is getting ready to throw away or get rid of. Shortly after that, Jo V shows up. She tells me that she got the job here in the city where I live and that she is there to live with me for a few months. I was sitting in my easy chair in my office. It was sitting in the middle of the room. We both held out our arms for a hug, and she kind of jumped on me. as though we were celebrating. I think she was actually just leaning over to hug me. It tipped the chair over backwards. We were laying on the floor laughing. The older Matthew came in to see what was going on. I told him that Jo V had gotten the job and was going to be staying with me for a few months. I took her into my bedroom to show her how I had been cleaning up and cleaning out and getting ready for her. Darren showed up. When I opened the front door he was standing there and I could see that he was upset. It turns out that he was upset about the letter that he needs to sign for my name change. He came in, something about him climbing in bed with me, and he was mad because I wouldn't be intimate with him. He ended up leaving. I don't know if this is another part or another dream. I think it was related to my having a lot of difficulty waking up this morning. I was at DVC. I was having a lot of trouble staying awake. I was waiting for someone there. I think I had an appointment. Because I was having so much trouble staying awake they thought I was ill. They were trying to help me. I decided that I just needed to go home. So they were going to find someone to take home since it was not safe for me to drive like that. They helped me into a chair, but I slid way down almost out of the chair as I was falling asleep. Then they came and got me up and took me outside. As I reached the grass I slumped down into the grass on my stomach and fell asleep. They got me under a tree and then were going to go get someone else to help them. They got two men that worked in the warehouse, doing shipping etc. One of these men came out and took him into the warehouse. I think he was having me wait there until he could take me home. This woman inspector came from some kind of agency. This made everyone very nervous and they were worried about her seeing me lying there asleep. One of the men was going to hide me in between these boxes and hope that she wouldn't find me there. I noticed a very large empty box and started to climb inside it. There were two men standing there talking about whether or not that was a good idea. Then I saw another very long box that I could lie down in. There was also something about a long, flat box that was about the width and depth of a briefcase but maybe 5-6 feet long. You could put this box into a briefcase and pull the briefcase together to make it easier to carry the box.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-07-31),-0.057342876,-0.37100294,-0.25546294,0.18340625

470,"Lots of wild scenes from the old I Love Lucy show. I was living with them. We were in their apartment and, I think it was mostly Lucy, but there were many of us there. We were all creative type people. I'm thinking maybe artists or some type of designers. I had a pile of my work that had been set aside. People had been setting it aside and not paying much attention to it. Finally someone said something about my work and that someone in particular had really liked it. Lucy spoke up and affirmed that we needed to market my things more, that I really did have a lot to offer. I was doing this thing that I have done before in a dream, where I can suspend myself in the air a few feet off the floor, with intention. I am able to do it much longer than most people. Carmen A was there. I know she wants to fly, so I told her that she and I should practice this more. I said the more we practice the longer we will be able to stay in the air and the longer we are in the air the more it will feel like flying. I picked up my work because other people were being critical. Their criticism made me decide that I needed to leave this group. They weren't supporting me and they weren't giving me the energy I needed to follow and use this work for others. When I left the group Lucy was now someone else but I don't know who. I don't have a name or image. Maybe an angel? I have no idea why I would think that. When I took my work and left her apartment because of the lack of support I was receiving from the group, I moved into a separate apartment or. At this point it seemed like a hotel room. I left the room for a little while. When I returned in the evening I found 3-4 female artists there. They all seemed to be dressed in black and white. I was surprised to see them there because I thought this was my private space that I had retreated to when I left the group and that lack of support. They didn't actually apologize for being there but they said they hoped I wouldn't mind. I realized that the same person owned this space and for that reason these other people had keys. Even though I had tried to leave the group so I could be alone and nurture my gift, my creativity, my uniqueness, my individuality. These other people followed. They wanted to leave the group also and were coming to me because they felt some type of solidarity with me and/or my work. I went out and started doing more work and it was becoming more and more accepted and appreciated. More and more of the people from the original group were coming to me and affirming my work. I heard that Lucy's original group had decided to disband. She was going to bring a new group of people together. Some would be from the old group. I was to be a major part of this new group. She wanted to start promoting my work more. I said that I wanted to do an elf portrait [not a typo] where my hands would be covering my eyes to protect my inner self. My hands are covering my eyes because I do not want to see, And my knees are pulled up to my chest to protect my inner self, And as I am stretching out my hands and my legs, I begin to intentionally explore and develop my inner being in the world around me as I experience it. As I experience the world around me, I experience my inner self. As I experience my inner self more intentionally, I more fully experience the outer world. I also did a creative piece of a tree. There was a poem that I created and recited about this tree and as soon as I did I felt the ground slowly and dramatically. Then I lifted my head and I said, I need to write that down. I didn't write it down in the dream. I simply recited it. This was the poem. As a tree I stand tall and I weather the wind and the snow. And as the rain falls, my leaves and my branches absorb its nourishment and it helps me to grow. As the sun beats down I dry and I become withered and wilted. The rain comes again. My Branches begin to flourish and I begin to bud. The sun shines warmly upon me. I move gently with the wind. The fullness of my beauty begins to develop. Someone noticed that when I put myself in the physical position of my self-portrait that my index fingers were pointing up. They thought it meant something about. I don't remember now exactly but I interpreted it to mean something about spirituality. I said, but that's exactly me. My life journey is this intentional exploration and development of self and spirituality and how do I better explore and understand myself through my dreams and through spirituality and how do I help others with this path? As I was saying this it was as if there was a film of pictures depicting spirituality. Though they were abstracts, they seemed to be. I say it was a film but they seemed to be moving vertically up this wall. The image was similar to that of a film being projected onto a screen. They weren't actually pictures hanging on a wall, but rather just the images moving quickly up the wall from the bottom to the top and then disappearing into the ceiling. They were moving fairly quickly, though you could still see the images and you could see that they were all individual pictures. The colors were all very soft. The backgrounds were all white. They all had a lot of white space on them.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-08-10),-0.0120707825,-0.101043,0.1514491,-0.1557771
471,"I was working for SVH. I had two sons. One was Matthew's current age and one much younger. They were helping me get things ready so I could leave for the day and part of it was reconciling the cash. The boys were arguing about something. I told the older one that he needed to be patient with the younger one, because even the older one was getting impatient with me at that time about wanting to do things differently than I wanted him to. That's what was happening with the little one also. The older one was hassling him, trying to make him do it a certain way. I said to the older one, but you're getting upset with me right now for the very same thing. You don't want me to show you how I want it done or how it needs to be done. You want me to just let you do it your way. When we were in our car, ready to go home, it was just Matthew at his current age and myself. We were driving a pickup truck. He started to back up and I started saying, The gate is down! The gate is down! I had to say it 4-5 times before he stopped. By the time he stopped it was too late. He had hit another vehicle so the gate lifted the other car, moved it over a bit, and pushed it back. In doing so, he hurt two other boys. One was Matthew's current age. The other was the age of the younger Matthew in the dream earlier. The younger one wasn't seriously injured but the older one was fighting for his life, he was unconscious. The doctors and nurses kept telling me that they didn't know if he would pull through or not. I didn't want to leave the hospital because I was so worried about the boy and I was frustrated with Matthew. I felt it happened because of a typical behavior of his, not listening to words of caution, thinking that he already knows best. Until something happens, he tends to have to learn his lessons the hard way. I was frustrated because I didn't want someone to have to lose their life before Matthew would start driving more carefully and about being more open to other people's advice. I was very concerned and upset. I took to the younger boy and asked him if he believed in God. His grandmother was there. One of them said that they did. I was cleaning the equipment around the older boy's bed. Something I did seemed to make a difference. There seemed to be a turn for the better. As I was cleaning I kept praying and praying asking God to please let him pull through. Part of me felt as though I was praying for the boy for the wrong reason. I really wanted him to pull through for himself and for his family, but also for Matthew. I felt really bad about what happened and because Matthew is my son. Even though he is 19, I still feel very responsible for him and the person he is and his behavior. From that respect I felt horrible about what happened. So I was praying for our sake as well. Whatever I did caused a slight improvement. The doctors were still telling us to be very cautious and not get overly optimistic. He said it was a good sign but it did not mean that he was completely out of danger. The little boy said he saw his brother holding out his hand for him and he thought that meant that he was going to be okay. I wanted to say to the boy, you know, if you see him holding out his hand, maybe that means that God is holding out his hand for your brother, and we should take comfort in that. It doesn't matter if God is going to walk him home to heaven or walk him home to you. We should take comfort that God is going to walk with him. But I didn't say it because I wasn't sure if it was an appropriate thing for me to say. Would it be appropriate for me to say as the person I was in the dream and am now? Would it be appropriate for me to say as a spiritual director? Does it make a difference? I knew some of the nurses and other employees because I worked there. We were going to start having monthly movie nights at our department, or center, where we work. We may have just done one. I think it may have been two connected departments and I worked in the other. I was going to be in charge of this with a couple of nurses from the other department. That particular time we had done it in their department. I was walking around, cleaning up, sweeping the floors. There was something about the fact that we shouldn't spend our time doing that. I thought I should be able to do that if I wanted to. It makes things look better and I don't mind sweeping up after someone else. There was a discussion about that room not being very important compared to what we do. Maybe even that didn't support our basic philosophies or values. I'm not sure I understand that. I continued to sweep and clean up. In fact, in the one area where the other nurses were, there were doors open and I was trying to sweep some of the leaves up and outside. The leaves were blowing in and around the room. It didn't seem to bother me. I was aware of it, but it wasn't frustrating me that more leaves kept blowing back in. I thought I would just do the best that I could. I had moved back to my area and was sweeping one of the rooms there. I thought the room I was in would be a nice place to have the monthly movie nights and that I should check with my manager to see if they would mind that. It's a room that we could stretch out; maybe even lay on the floor. I was thinking how comfortable the basic plastic molded chairs in this room would be compared to the student chairs with desktops that were in the other room. Then I thought maybe not. At first I had the impression that it was carpeted but it wasn't. I started to wonder if there was a screen in there that we could show the movie on. I don't think there was and I didn't know what would be involved in getting one in there. I finally decided it would just be best to continue using the room that we had used. Somehow I knew that Br. Barry had been brought in on this conversation about to sweep or not to sweep. It seems that he could see where we were both coming from, and didn't really see the problem if I had the time or even if I wanted to do it on my own time. I realized that no one had been talking to the older boy who had been hurt. I thought maybe I should go tell his younger brother that he should go talk to him. Some people believe that people who are unconscious or in a coma can hear you talk to them or that it does make a difference in their recovery. I thought it might be good for the younger boy as well, to talk to his brother. Then I thought I should tell Matthew that as well. Matthew should go talk to the young man and make his peace with the situation in case the boy didn't make it. I didn't think Matthew had any idea it would be for him if this young man doesn't pull through. I felt it was very important that he go talk to him, to apologize, or whatever else he felt he needed to say. Again, I didn't know if that was appropriate to tell the two of them to go talk to them. I was in training to become a doctor. I was seeing this patient, even though I realized that I had two more years before I would actually be a doctor. I was referring to myself as a doctor to her. It wasn't until later that I realized that was inappropriate and I should clarify to her that I still had two more years of education. Whatever her problem was, I had taken care of it for her. I had gone into this classroom where we were later going to be viewing a movie together. The mother of the woman whom I had treated, or spoken with, was there. She was waiting for her daughter so they could go home. Ben D was in this room. I was excited to see him there. I was debating what I should say to him, should I express my personal interest, was there something that I could say to get him to ask me out. I just tried to be very kind, friendly, and not overly so. I was surprised that he was there. I learned that he had come to attend a lecture and that he does this quite often. So then I thought I should tell him if he is ever in the city where I live that he should give me a call and we could have dinner, similar to what he had said to me in waking life. I went into the room a few times and chatted with him briefly. The mother of this woman that I had treated was there also. I finally realized that Ben D was hanging around to take her to dinner after her daughter was finished there. This disappointed me, that he was there to socialize with this other woman, and he wasn't expressing any additional interest in seeing me socially. I was stewing over this, wondering if there was anything that I could or should do or say. I was contemplating how I was feeling about this experience and what, if anything, I should do. The young man did die. As soon as Matthew heard, he broke down in tears. He was very upset. I had not had the opportunity to suggest that he talk to the young man, even though the young man was in a coma. We were at home and Matthew was in the shower trying to relax. I was going to go rub his back or something to help him relax. I had a method or ritual or something to try to help him relax. aromatherapy, music, etc. It occurred to me that some people might find this inappropriate but since we were both in bathing suits I decided that it was fine. I knew how upset Matthew was and I wanted to help him. but myself as well because I was also very upset by the whole thing. Prior to this, there were approximately 20 workmen outside of my house doing some repairs. They had finished their work. On the kitchen counter there was a 1 _ inch to 2-inch gap between the cabinet and the counter. kind of like a hole. It was probably 12 inches long but it was arched. I thought it was terrible. One of them said there was nothing that could be done. I was going to talk to one of the other workers to verify that or to find someone who could fix it. Then there were even more people there. People that I knew. They wanted to know about this ritual that I use for relaxation. They wanted to witness it. They were waiting for me to prepare everything. Probably 15 of them were waiting outside. It was very hot, so they had removed their shirts. I had gone out for a minute. I jokingly said something about fifteen shirtless men sitting in my front yard and that not happening very often. They all laughed. I had some of the people helping me collect candles. My shower was something like you would see in a health club. It was almost like three shower stalls, divided, but the partition-dividers were clear so you could see through them, and they were long and narrow. Lots of people had gathered in these three shower stalls to watch the ritual. They were all clothed. They didn't seem to be showering, but the water was on. They were sitting in a row, because the stalls were long and narrow and they couldn't stand or sit 2 or 3 people across. I told them that to do the ritual I would need all of the people out of there. They all cleared out and were helping me put the candles in but they were putting them in the wrong places. In the one shower stall that I was going to be using there were quite a few plants on the one end, ivy and hanging plants, etc. I was placing the candles very carefully so they wouldn't light the plants on fire. I had them replace some of the candles because I only wanted candles that were either white or very dark colors such as maroon, green and navy. There was also a man in there filming it. But he was filming it while all the other people were in there. I said, I do believe it may be useful for people to have a video of this ritual because they could see it being performed and learn to use it for themselves or their loved ones. However, I think it should be done right if you are going to do it. He found a blank tape that was a minute or two long. I told him that wasn't really going to do much good. Then he found another one that was much longer. I had two women friends, close to me. I didn't have a place to change into my swimsuit. There were so many people around I couldn't find a private place to change. I thought I had found a place but then that didn't work out. Then all these men and some other people decided they would create a barrier for me by surrounding me, with their backs to me, so I could change. I did that. Two of the women who were particularly close to me were trying to help me. I wanted to slip it down over my head and they said that wouldn't work. They said I wouldn't be able to keep myself covered that way so I stepped into the swimsuit and pulled it up. I removed my top while they simultaneously pulled my swimsuit up. This worked very well. I went into the shower. When Matthew came in he was a very small child, maybe only one year old. I'm not sure he could even sit up by himself. I was sitting on the floor of the shower and he was sitting with me, between my legs but facing away from me, as a parent and child might sit on the floor when playing. I was bathing him and all the candles were lit.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-08-11),-0.3215482,-0.09415483,-0.21525477,0.16087386
472,"Jennifer K had called to ask me for some information, if I remembered much about canoeing on the Whitewater River. She thought she remembered their being some places that were steep, uphill, that were very difficult paddling and also severe turns. I didn't recall that and also told her that the furthest I recall canoeing there was beginning in BR and going just south of her parent's house. Her and I and a friend of ours made arrangements for a weekend outing. I think it was going to include this canoeing. I don't know if it was just one day or a weekend. We arrived at this place. It almost looks like several highway interchanges criss-crossing over, under and around each other. They had cement walls along the outside. Some people were setting up tables along these walls, like card table and chairs. It was to solicit business from pedestrians or people walking by. The one man I knew. As I waiting for Jennifer C and the other girl I went and sat down across from him. Then I said, Oh. I'm sorry I won't do that. I don't want people to think you're busy. I don't want to cost you any business. Jennifer C and this other girl showed up and we were sitting our things in piles along these walls. These two friends of hers show up and the original three of us start discussing splitting the cost. We realized that these two friends of this other girl were there to share the outing as well. So one of us said something about us splitting the cost five ways now. The one girl said, No. My agreement with the two of you was that we would split it three ways. So we will still do that. I will split my third three ways with my two friends. This bothered me, as it didn't seem right. Even though we had an agreement to split it three ways, it seemed that if we now had five people, the most fair thing was to split the cost five ways. As it turned out, none of the three of them spent any time with Jennifer C and I. I'm alone again, still on these ramps, waiting for Jennifer C. There were two car crashes. The one man that I had gone to sit with at his table was Asian and someone that I knew. The first car accident struck him and it severely severed his leg. I don't think it completely severed it and it was low on the leg. He shows up later in a cast and on crutches. When the second crash occurs, it completely severs a man's leg, very near the hip. He is yelling and carrying around, not over pain, but more angry at the inconvenience of it. The Asian man brings a kitchen-size wastebasket over for the man to prop his hip on to catch the blood. The other part of his leg flew off somewhere. He was yelling something about a brother, that he thought was somehow responsible for this because he was covering for his brother and if he hadn't been covering for his brother he wouldn't have been there and it wouldn't have happened. I don't remember the details clearly. He seems to be more upset about that than the pain. I'm not sure but I think I was thinking that I have wondered before if there is a place in BR that I can get on the Whitewater or that there was a waterway that I could get on in BR. I wasn't sure if it was Whitewater and/or I wasn't sure where it would lead me if I did get it on it where I was thinking about getting on it in BR. I was talking to some of these people at these ramps, the Asian in particular, about that. Somehow these ramps had something to do with that. He said, Whenever I've taken the one that I thought was the right one, that it always led me where I expected it to. Somehow I had the sense led to where I was talking about. I walked down the ramp to one point. I had some sense that the Asian man was right, but yet I still felt pretty uncomfortable with it. So I just walked back up and decided to wait for Jennifer C. This man with the severed leg. I don't know if there was just a mess surrounding him or if I just realized that it was a dangerous area. I picked up my and Jennifer C's things and moved them to another area. Then when she finally returned I told her that I had moved this stuff. Two of the things were nail clippers and manicure scissors. It was all just very small things, like toiletry things. Her and I were sitting there talking. She asked for my thoughts on the outing, especially as it pertained to these other three women. I shared with her what I thought. I returned home and I realized that I didn't ask Jennifer C for her take on the situation. I decided that I would send her a thank you note and tell her that I enjoyed spending the time with her and acknowledge that I had not asked her opinion of the situation. I would apologize for that in the note and ask her to let me know her thoughts.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-08-13),-0.19414331,-0.087298915,0.13025606,0.017701764

He turned around and saw I wasn't behind him. He asked if I was coming. I said yes. I had something very large in my hand but I don't know what it was. I put my jacket on and headed out the door. I'm now at a post office. I see a man named Scott. I knew him but don't know who it is in waking life. He's a new member of CRHP XII. We were exchanging pleasantries, etc. Helen J comes in. I act very excited to see her. I approach her, give her a hug, we chat. I turned around and said, Oh, have you met Scott? She said she had not. I told her that he is our newest CRHP XII member. I introduced them. They were now chatting and a couple more of my CRHP sisters came in. I jokingly asked if someone had made arrangements for CRHP to meet at the post office. Anne C was one of the ones who had just come in. I don't know who the others were. I gave her a hug and chatted with her a bit.

476,"It was Wednesday and I was sitting in the living room, eating dinner while watching TV. Matthew came in. It startled me because I wasn't expecting him home. He had a laundry basket in his hand. He said, Hi mom! He told me that one of his friends was coming home that evening so he decided to ride along to come and pick up his car. I think his friend's name was Doug. I appreciated this because that would keep me from having to drive up to get him on Thursday evening and bring him back to get his car. After he walked out of the room I realized I was sitting there without a blouse on, so I grabbed a round laundry basket and held it up in front of myself and went upstairs to put a blouse on before Matthew realized I had been sitting there like that.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-08-27),-0.049092505,-0.119183406,-0.19614157,0.09004535

They were very, very tiny. They looked like little black dots. Two of them were in the air in front of me. I tried to use one of my ice cubes and swat at it. I missed. I heard mother say, Anna.

I realized I couldn't or shouldn't as the current owners were there. There was some kind of community picnic going on. The residents were participating in special activities. I was trying to walk through. not sure where I was going. and trying to stay out of the way. There was something to do with me climbing up a tall ladder or something and something to do with a swimming pool or water. I noticed two attractive men sitting and talking.

482,"I was putting up a few Christmas decorations on top of a large wooden piece of furniture. It was primarily a wooden sled, not solid wood but rather looked like a frame of sled for lack of a better description; some reindeer and they had lights on them. I offered to put them up for a neighbor as well. He declined because of the time of the year. I thought this was quite odd for me, also. I usually put my tree and decorations up the weekend after Thanksgiving and take them down a day or two after Christmas. I was picking up the newspapers in the yard for two of the neighbors. They had come apart a bit so I was sorting the sections and making sure each neighbor got all the sections they were supposed to. Bev's children were going to spend the weekend with me. It ended up that Rachel S was there 1-2 nights early to spend the night. She was at the top of the steps and asked if she could play Nintendo. I told her it was bedtime. I went up to tuck her back in bed and Bev was there too. She was saying that she needed to head for home. I told her that it was so late, about 11 pm, so I thought she should spend the night and drive home in the morning. Otherwise she would be driving until 1 or 1:30 am. I don't know what she decided to do. Rachel S came downstairs in her pajamas. I picked her up to take her back up to bed. I was noticing that she had gained a lot of weight and I felt bad for her. I was thinking about the difficulty all of my siblings and I have in maintaining our weight. it is a constant battle for all of us. I had taken Rachel S to preschool or something and I went into the room to pick her up after. I had a coffee cup with my name on it. Anna. I sat it down on a shelf with all of the children's cups. I went back in a few minutes later to pick it up and it wasn't there any longer. Someone said they thought they knew where it was and they went to get it. I saw an old friend and we were chatting. I said something about talking with or seeing Susan J. She said she would have liked to see her too. I said that I might arrange that the next time. I went to Mass. There were many people coming in at one time. I wanted to sit in one of the back seats because I knew I had to leave at 9:30 am. I chose one seat and when I knelt down I could not put my legs straight back. As soon as I had the opportunity I got up and moved up a few rows further. Someone was talking to Jerry Lewis about his diet and he showed them a storage room where he kept all of his favorite diet foods. It was a very large room with a high ceiling. It had large, commercial-size containers of everything, like they would have at places that serve food to large groups. I saw large jars of what appeared to be olive pieces for salads. I thought that was a good idea. Something new I could put on my salads. Susan J, Marlene F, and myself were all grocery shopping together. All of the things we were selecting from were these dietary things of Jerry's. I had several bags of potato chips in my cart. I thought this might be a nice change for me if they are good for his diet, they might be good for mine.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-09-02),-0.29400316,-0.0061822087,0.14356029,-0.15406267
484,"I was at my SDI at the BE Retreat Center but it looked different than it does in waking life. The people weren't all the same. Sister Betty was there. There was a man that it seems as though I knew but I now can't remember who he was. For some reason I was feeling ill or out of place. Whatever it was I didn't want to explain to people what was making me feel the way I was. I was also saying that it was just going to take time for me to start feeling normal. It reminds me of one of the medications that the doctor had me on and the withdrawal symptoms I experienced when I tried to quit the medication, before I finally started feeling better. That is what the physical feelings remind me of. Some of the people there, especially this one man, were involved in the occasional use of recreational drugs. I wouldn't have anything to do with it. He was saying that a lot of the people there had used this drug and as a result they were being very silly. They seemed to be having a lot of fun, but I still didn't want any part of it.

485,"Matthew and I were on a train. He was younger than in waking life. maybe 9 or 10 years old. The train was headed south. We were sleeping. The cars we were on were more like carrier cars. long, flat, and narrow with no structure to them. no walls, seats, etc. I thought they were probably too narrow for Matthew and I too lay side by side so he was lying ahead of me. At times I was in a semi-waking state. I could hear them making announcements and such. They were talking about various trains in the south, and their appeal to families for vacations because of their childlike nature. They were designed to look like various animals and characters. They were also talking about an upcoming trip that was $900 for 8 days, or nights. I thought this was a great deal and maybe something I would be able to afford if things go well will my job. At first I was thinking it would be $900 for the both of us then I realized that was silly for me to think that, that of course it would be $900 for each of us. Still the idea appealed to me. At that point I fully woke up and was looking around me and wondering where we were. I saw a professional football team practicing. Their uniforms were gold and maroon and they were called the cougars. A little while later I saw another football team practicing. Their shirts were maroon and they were also called the cougar. I saw one member of the flag corp with a flag. As they moved the flag into an upright position I could see that it said, Gould High School. At first I thought this was the same team as the first, but later realized they were two different teams. The train seemed to go through factory lots and such. It was in one such lot that the train ride ended. I realized we had a problem because this was not where we wanted to be. I saw a man walking around on the grounds so I got his attention and asked him where we could catch another train. He headed to a door to an UAW building. I told Matthew to walk faster because we didn't want to lose this man. We didn't seem to have any luggage or anything. We entered through one of a set of glass double doors. It was a very large room with shiny, clean grey floors, like you might see in a factory. At the end of the room I could see doors to two small rooms or offices. The man pointed down that way. At first I wasn't sure which door he was pointing to and then I saw a woman stand up from behind a desk. I recognized it as the same type of setting I had been in before regarding this train trip. Matthew and I went to that office. I walked in and asked where we could get on the next train headed north. She typed into her computer and then said, Kilamanjaro and pointed out a window to her left, our right. I asked how soon and got the impression it would be leaving very soon. I clarified and tried to get her to tell me clearly where we needed to go. She and/or I repeated something about Kilamanjaro one or two more times. I had the sense that where we needed to be was about ten minutes away. I was wondering where our luggage was, if we had any, and where our tickets were. I thought that I should probably have kept the tickets on my person. At this point I felt as though I was half-awake in waking life. I thought I was just lying in bed reviewing and remembering the dream, because I could hear my alarm clock playing. It had been playing for a half-hour or so. I didn't get up to turn it off because I knew I didn't really need to get up that early today. This is all very odd and I'm not sure how better to explain it. I recorded the dream clearly as I recall it, yet when I was still in bed, I was thinking about the dream and near the end was thinking this is going to be a problem, not knowing if we have luggage, if we do, where is it and how are we going to get it, where are our tickets, etc. Yet, I wasn't upset or panicked. I just realized that there was a problem. Maybe I wasn't upset because I also realized it was a dream.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-09-05),-0.032656685,-0.14479148,-0.019636834,0.021166427

496,"I was in Hawaii with my husband. My husband was Craig T. Nelson, from TV. We were at an outdoor cafe or restaurant. We were sitting at a small square table, for two or four, I'm not sure which. We were sitting across the table from each other. The waiter at one point brought some lobster. He said he had two for each of us. I said, oh no, one is more than enough for me. He went ahead and gave me two of them, or he gave me one and gave Craig my second one. We were eating this lobster. We were very much in love and being very affectionate. I decided that when the waiter came back I was going to ask him to move my place setting to the side of the table so I could sit closer to Craig. They were also playing Island music. At one point it was very, very fast. At this point it was as if I had a bird's eye view of the island. I could almost see it vibrating, see the earth vibrating. I said, Gosh. If they keep this up they are going to create a whole separate island. There also seemed to be a child, maybe 9 or 10 years old, maybe younger, I don't know. I don't know who the child with. He had been putting food down this hole in the ground. He had been doing it because he realized that there were people living down where this hole led. So he was giving them food.

When I looked at the whole, it was as though you were looking into someone's basement. You could see a tile floor that you might see in a home basement. That's where these people were. I have the sense that they weren't supposed to be there but they were living there and hoping not to be discovered.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-10-13),-0.17331673,-0.039080493,-0.069869116,-0.12645474
497,"I thought Matthew had come home. He was working in his bedroom, cleaning out his closets and such. He was carrying stuff outside. I went upstairs to talk to him. I wanted to talk to him alone. I wanted to ask him if he and I would ever have the chance to talk alone anymore, since he has been dating Ashley B. It seems that I never have anytime to talk to him alone. I never have anytime alone with him at all. I got very upset with him, but I'm not sure why. It may have been related to church, but I'm not sure. It also seems that I thought one of the maintenance men from WN was there working on the apartment but I don't know what he was doing. He had left the screen door open. Another time he was doing something upstairs and had the water running. it was leaking through the ceiling to the first floor. I felt frustrated with him and told him what was happening. I also had this sense, and I don't know where this fits. it may be something separate. I really wanted to wake up but couldn't. I had reached out to the coffee table and was pulling myself, trying to pull myself to wake myself up.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-10-13),-0.17925788,-0.15854204,-0.37410465,0.040909644
501,"I was sharing an apartment with a woman named Sharon. She was getting ready to go out one evening. I was going to be staying in. She had been trying different outfits on. She tried on a suit, pants and a jacket. She asked me if it looked appropriate. I said it did. I told her it looked great. I thought she was going to meet a friend, I don't know if the friend was male or female. She leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek when she got ready to go. I thought it was odd but I kissed her cheek in return. After she left, I ordered a large pizza for dinner. I ordered a large so I would have leftovers for other meals. I took off most of my clothes because I was getting ready to do laundry. My pizza was delivered and I was ready to start my laundry. Sharon came home, very early. Her parents and her brother were with her. I was embarrassed because I didn't have many clothes on, because of the large pizza, and because I the apartment seemed a mess with my laundry out. I was grabbing up my clothes and said something about it all. Sharon was telling her family how wonderful she thought I was. I think I asked her if she was just saying that because my birthday was coming up on Wednesday. She said no. I don't remember what I said next but she said she was 61. I couldn't believe that she looked as good as she did at 61. I would never have guessed her to be more than mid 40's. It seems that there was something about romance between her brother and I. I don't know if she wanted to try to get us together, if he was interested in getting together with me, or vice versa. Just not sure.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-12-01),-0.260143,-0.20381255,0.058406293,-0.34398395
502,"I was staying at Uncle J and Aunt A's house. [I'm not sure how to explain this but in recalling the dream it isn't until later that I realize why I am there.] I was staying overnight. I was sleeping in their basement. One part of it was a large open room and other parts of it seemed to be like separate small rooms yet not separated by four walls and a door. The big open area was packed with miscellaneous furniture. It was hard to find room to walk around it. There also seemed to be several beds down there. They had me sleep in a bed that was near the bottom of the steps, but in this big open area. Donald K was going to be spending the night also and he was going to be sleeping that bed so they had to put me someplace else. Sandy K and Carol K were there also. They were going to be sleeping in one of the more separate areas. They found another area for me to sleep. I was thinking about cleaning up/organizing that big open area. I didn't want to offend them. I just wanted to do it to be nice and helpful and I knew I could do it well. I didn't do it. I was thinking about the fact that I didn't know how they would feel about it. Bev was getting married. I was doing something and for some reason I realized I was running late for the wedding. There was a heated discussion about who was going to take a shower when and where. I think there were two separate shower/toilet areas. The toilet seemed to have three walls around it. only enough room for the toilet, and yet with no door. When I went to use it I had my long ivory sweater jacket with me and I hung it from something in front of me. I turned it to act as a curtain so no one could see in. There was someone standing out there and I told them, or asked them, to help hold it so no one would see in. The bathtub/showers had two walls and the shower curtains ran around the other two sides. There was some discussion about who was going to use the shower when. I agreed to wait until last. But, I was the maid of honor. Somehow I ended up running late. I looked at my watch and it was 11:45. I realized the wedding was going to start in one half-hour. I hadn't showered yet. I still had to shower, dress, and get to the church. I was very upset and panicked so I didn't even shower. I just grabbed my stuff and left. I don't remember who drove me. I think it was on the way there that I realized that there was something all over the left shoulder. It was covered in white candle wax. I was so angry with myself for not checking it earlier. I realized that I had worn it before I should have at least checked it, if not had it cleaned again. I was trying to crack and peel the dress off the dress. I didn't know if I could get it off. I didn't know how it would look. I realized at this point that I was late for the wedding and that they had postponed the start of the wedding because of me. I was so, so upset that I had done all this. Those things had not worked out better. I realized that part of it was my fault but I also felt that some of it had been out of my control. I knew that a lot of people were going to be very upset with me. I was very upset about that too. I was very upset about the whole thing.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-12-07),-0.0734576,-0.25468242,0.112204805,-0.107764974
508,"I had written letters to several of my old male friends. I wanted to reconnect with some or at least one of them that I could maintain a strong friendship with. I wanted the aspects of the opposite gender friendship, non-sexual though, that you don't get with a same gender friendship. So, I wanted to reconnect with one of these men. Tony S was the one I reconnected with. I think we were at his house sitting on the sofa talking. He said he wanted very much to reconnect and reestablish a strong friendship. But then he also told me that he had always loved me. I don't know how I felt about that. We ended up making love and I had very mixed feelings about this. Because his wife, Dorothy S, is my friend also. I had no desire to betray her. No desire to break up anyone's marriage. Yet, it felt very good to reconnect with Tony S. I suppose in waking life there was some attraction to Tony S though I can't imagine wanting to have a romantic relationship with him because we are too different. I think the attraction was simply that Tony S is just fun to be around. I was going to just leave and get out of the house before Dorothy S came home. In this scene Tony S wasn't there either. There was a male friend of theirs and some other men came in. They were going to be staying there. They were surprised to see me there. They didn't know me and I made some excuse as to why I was there and said I was just leaving. As I was walking out I say Dorothy S sitting on a step. She was holding something in her hand and was sobbing. I thought I was going to just sneak out without her seeing me. As I got out the door I heard her say goodbye to me. I was going to just ignore it and act as though I didn't hear it. Then I heard her yell it again. So, I called back and said goodbye to her. I think I had another conversation with Tony S, or maybe a conversation with Dorothy S. Maybe I assured her that I was only there because I wanted to reconnect with my old male friends to regain the perspective that I get from my male friends.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-12-22),-0.05046825,-0.005825348,-0.4103196,-0.1742124
510,"I was spending a week or so with a wealthy family member who owned and lived in a mansion. I was there to help them with some type of program. As part of this program we had invited in a bunch of women who were brides. maybe 50. They were invited to wear their wedding gowns for the entire seven days that they were there. Some of they did and some of them didn't. Later in the week I was riding down an escalator in the home with a bunch of them. I asked them how it felt to be able to wear their wedding gowns for a whole week and some of them loved it and some of them said they hated it. They said they were just sick of it. I kind of chuckled and said, Is that because of how uncomfortable it is, or maybe too heavy? I don't think anyone answered. There was another group approaching as we were getting off the escalator. Another group of brides was approaching to go up the escalator. Deena A was there. I was in a hurry and didn't have to stop. Just as I was walking past her I said hello. She was sitting with some other people. She was going through some papers. I said, Hi Deena A. How are you? I could tell by her response that she wasn't doing well, maybe upset or aggravated. I ran into Steve B. I think we walked together for a little while and chatting while we walked. Asking each other how we were doing etc. He was talking about how busy this week was and that it's very difficult to enjoy yourself during a time like this. I said, Yes, I guess I know. I haven't had time to spend with any of my old DDSI friends because I was so busy attending to these people. He said, Yes. I said, but that's not to say that I'm not enjoying myself. It's just that, like you, I wish I had time to spend with my old friends. He said, I'm in agreement. About that time I saw Deena A the second time and stopped to see what was going on with her. I took a minute to sit with her. I said, Okay Girlfriend. Tell me what's going on. She said something about me introducing myself under a different name. That wasn't why she was upset but she said that she noticed that and was curious about it. I don't remember her telling me why she was upset. I saw two of our visitors sitting together on a settee. I stopped long enough to say hello and ask how they were doing. It was morning and I wanted to make sure that they had gotten breakfast. One of them said she had just finished with her translator. I said, Okay. I just nodded and said, Okay and continued on my way. Some family member had at one point taken me into a formal dining room. We were going to have some additional guests in a day or two. We were going to be having a dinner or something in this room. Off of the back of this room there were doors at either end. single French doors that lead into a very small narrow room. Looked kind of like a foyer. They said this would be a room that people could go into to have a quieter place to chat. I think there was similar room at each end of the dining room as well, but they weren't as long as the one off the back. They also each were connected by a French door. I was thinking that each of those led to a restroom. I went in there two or three times to check on something. I was doing a preparatory check. I was talking to one of the other family members, maybe the female owner of the home, about the carpets needing to be cleaned. She agreed but we decided to wait until after the bridal program was over. At first we talked about just getting certain rooms done and then get the others done later. I decided to just wait and have them do it all at once. It had been quite awhile since all the carpets had been cleaned. Money certainly wasn't an issue. The bedroom where I was staying was part of a suite. I had the whole suite to myself. I had come out from watching TV and I heard someone else's TV playing. I walked around to see where it was or who was up. I saw where it was coming from but the door was closed so I decided not to bother them. Then I started wondering if I had my own TV turned up so loud that other people heard it. I didn't want to have done that.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-01-11),-0.20979838,-0.03617358,0.20531638,-0.30100894
512,"My flower gardens, but not the flowerbeds here. I don't know where I was initially. There was someone, maybe my Dad but not my waking life Dad. We were working together on planting some things. He was helping me. I remember thinking that if I worked with him on this on a yearly basis that eventually I would learn enough that I would be fine when he is gone. I would know what to do and things such as that. There were two green plants. I don't remember if they were flowering plants or not. He had planted them very close together. At first I thought it was very odd and then I realized it would be a very good look as they matured. It would be very pretty the way they were placed. He was putting something like a very dark rich dirt around them. He was piling it up kind of high around them. One of them had a little pink ball of fuzz sticking out of it. I noticed it and was going to go pull it out but I don't think I did. I was sleeping but needed to get up. There were a lot of people around. I was at a house that I had either just moved into or was going to be moving into. I had a sense that it was like our house on Lakeland Dr. Maybe it was that house but it didn't necessarily look like it. I was walking around looking at the flowerbeds and such. All of my roses were gone from the front flowerbed. The previous owners had extended the flowerbeds all across the front of the house and around the right side and back. In the front they had also extended them down along the side of the driveway. They had made this big rounded, odd shaped flowerbed. It resembled what I've seen on HGTV. I recall seeing Wisteria someplace. It may have been in one of my dreams. When I saw this Wisteria I thought it was very pretty and wanted to remember to put it on my list of things that I want to put in my flowerbeds this spring. I saw that they had lots of Wisteria there. I thought that was very cool. I noticed there was a theme to their flowers. Most of the flowers were yellow and lavender. There might have been some white. I was disappointed that my roses were gone. As I continued around the house I noticed they had many plant hangers in the trees. There were many more mature trees close to the house than there used to be. These plant hangers were very long. Some of them were large. Some were made of iron. They had a hook on one end that you could just hook them onto a branch of the tree. They other end was a hook to hang the plant on. Some were simple colors like brown, black, and white. They were very ornate. Some were very colorful. Some were shaped steel- kind of like a spiral. Some seemed to be carved wood. The more ornate colorful ones were wood. They were very shiny and smooth to the touch. They were bunches of them hanging in the trees. I went around and pulled them all out so I could have them all in one spot and then decide from there where I wanted each one. The previous owner had left them for us. Darren was there at one point. We went around the left side of the house. There was a tall redwood fence. It was the one we had built when we lived there and built the deck but it looked taller and different. It was only along the side of the house. Darren was washing it down. It was so tall that Darren had to stand on the tips of his toes to reach the top. He was washing it all off. I said I was surprised that they left that when they tore the deck off. I went around to the backyard. The pool was still there but it looked as though they had put it in ground. I said I was surprised that they had left that, especially when state law requires that there be a six-foot fence with a locking gate around any pool. I said that we needed to get rid of it. I think we might have had some discussion about the fact that it could be cleaned up and usable. I didn't want to because of safety, I didn't want to put a fence up and because it is a lot of work to maintain. I said that we need to get rid of it immediately. Darren went and got a piece of hose to start siphoning the water out. The piece of hose that he got was only about 3-4 feet long. He started siphoning but then he cared the hose to the back of the property so that no part of the hose was left in the pool. Yet it still seemed to be working. I asked him how that could possibly work. He said he didn't know how to explain but it just does. He said you just use the hose to start siphoning and then you pull the hose out. The water was still somehow being pulled out of the pool and through the hose, as if by magnetic force. After some of the water starting siphoning out I realized that I could grab the pool and just pull it out of the ground and pour the water out. When I did that I realized that it wasn't our pool at all. They had just buried a child's pool into the ground. I finished draining the pool and then took it around to Darren to show him what they had done. I saw our neighbor's outside. The female neighbor looked like a very young Connie B. I thought that to myself. I thought is that really Connie B at a very young age or does it just look like Connie B at a very young age. It looked like her husband Glenn B talking to her so I'm not sure what that was about. These people lived on the left side of us just as Connie B and Glenn B did in waking life. The neighbors from the other side came out. That house looked very different than the one in waking life and the people were different. They were talking about the limestone on the outside of their house and how much they loved it. Somehow, when you walk around that side of our house, it seemed that we had to step on some of their limestone. So going back and forth from the front yard to the backyard I was constantly stepping on this. They were just going on and on about how great this limestone was and how much they loved it. I noticed when we were getting ready to drain the pool that there was another house kind of behind these two yet set back. I don't know how that could work. It wasn't the case in waking life. Darren and I were joking about these people loving their limestone so much. Darren said something about the man even eating off of the limestone. I think the neighbor overheard part of it. He said, You don't like limestone? What's the matter with you? I had been taking a nap or laying down. I opened my eyes and looked up. I saw a bunch of flowerpots sitting on a ledge or shelf just outside the window. They were all flowering. I don't remember what colors now. Some of them were tulips. I thought, Oh. My tulips. I can go ahead and plant the tulips Ashley B gave me for Christmas. Those are blooming already. I better hurry up and get mine planted. So I got up and got mine out of the refrigerator to start planting them. I noticed that the other thing that she gave me was Wisteria. I thought, Oh that's cool. I was thinking about going to buy Wisteria and here that's what she gave me. I heard someone coming so for some reason I thought I needed to hide these. I don't know why. I quickly put them back in bags and was about to put them back in the refrigerator. I don't think whoever it was saw what I had so I don't think it was a problem.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-01-17),-0.18106715,-0.07349952,0.05678123,-0.04232
513,I met Bill C at a restaurant. We were having a focus group. There were three women who were joining us for this focus group. One was Cathy L. One I don't know now who it was. One we called Annie W but it was Debbie We. Kara C was there also. Bill C had gone and hung up his and Kara C's coats. When the women came in I took them to our tables. They were hanging their coats on the back of their chairs. We all had long coats on so they were dragging on the floor. I had to come up with a way to push a lot of it through the back of the seat so it wouldn't drag on the floor. Then I sat on it that way. I showed the other women my idea. Then I saw someplace to hang them so I took them and hung them up. In the meantime Bill C was waiting in line for something. When the three women came in I said hello to Cathy L and then to the other woman. Then I said hello to Annie W. She asked if she knew me and I said yes. You know me as Elizabeth H although I go by Anna now. She didn't say anything else. We had the meeting. We got up and got our coats to leave. There was also something about some reports or papers or something and we needed to edit it maybe. There was something that wasn't quite right and I think I was telling Bill C what we needed to do to correct it.,elizabeth.tsv,(2003-01-21),-0.18231457,-0.053077012,0.19948895,-0.15771185
514,"I somehow was notified that Matthew was not going to be able to live with me nor see me for a period of probably six months or longer. I found out that BJ was responsible for this. She had learned that Darren was going to have to have heart bypass - 6 bypasses - surgery. She thought my feelings toward him were going to be harmful to him through Matthew. She felt that the surgery and his recovery would go much better if Matthew were living with him and having no contact with me. She convinced Darren's doctor of this and they did something to enforce this decision. I was absolutely livid. I think BJ, Bob F, F and I were at our birth home. I went and found BJ and I was having trouble speaking I was so angry. I kept asking, How could you do this? How could you do such a thing? She went into Mother and Daddy's bedroom. They were very upset. They were upset to see two of their children so torn apart. I decided that BJ would just have to no longer be a part of my life. ever. I just didn't think I could ever forgive her for this. Then I found out she had gone to Bob F and he supported her. Daddy was crying because he was so upset. I think he agreed with me but wanted to stay out of it. He didn't want to take sides. I think the same was true with Mother. I just remember seeing Matthew at a distance with Darren. Darren seemed unsure about the decision. as though he was glad for it yet realized it was not the right thing. You could tell Matthew didn't want it. but also didn't to do anything to endanger his Daddy's life. He looked very, very sad. I finally went to the doctor and begged him for a chance to talk to him privately. He agreed. I told him a little bit about BJ. How long she was married, what happened in their marriage. both to her and to her children. I asked him if he still trusted her judgement. He agreed that he had made the wrong decision and assured me he would get it overturned. He, my family, Darren, and Matthew were there, but I don't know where there was, when I found out that the decision had been overturned. Matthew ran up to me and hugged me for minutes.

518,"BJ was spending the night with me. I was in bed already and asleep. She had gone out for the evening and I heard her come in, lock, and chain the door. I thought that I should have given her the passcode but then didn't think anymore of it. I heard her in the office, as though she was getting ready for bed. I thought that I should get up and help her get the bed down, get her bed ready. There was a futon in there and I wasn't sure she would know how to lay the futon down. I wanted her to be comfortable so I was going to go in and lay it down for her. I called for her from bed but I don't think she heard me. So I got up and as I headed towards the office I called for her again once or twice and didn't hear a response. I said I'm calling because I don't want to frighten you. I couldn't see very well so I went back into my bedroom and got my flashlight and went back in. Then I realized she wasn't in there. She must have gone downstairs. I started straightening the office, moving some papers around and reorganizing some binders and such to make more room for her. She had laid her watch and something else on the floor so I picked them up and set them on a table where I had just made room. Just as I was about ready to lay the futon down I realized that I should just have her sleep in Matthew's room. That bed is ready and she would be more comfortable in there anyway. I was going to tell her that and I heard her downstairs talking to someone. It seems that it was someone who works for me and is always there at night. I heard that woman say that it was nice to have someone there at that time of night - someone to talk to. She was just being very friendly. She was a very large black woman.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-01-28),-0.17818272,-0.26294264,0.086294875,-0.077839404
519,"I died and was being lifted by some unseen power to heaven. Well, maybe to heaven. I'm not sure. I don't think I was afraid. As I was being lifted, I could see the world beneath me. I could see city lights and things. I had my hands folded in front of me. My biggest concern was Matthew and how difficult my death would be for him. I was thinking that at least I am headed in the right direction. I'm headed up and not down. There were several times that I prayed while I was being pulled up. It seemed to take along time to be lifted all the way up. While I was being lifted, I prayed several times, that God would comfort Matthew. I just kept asking God to help Matthew through this. I was now in a small room. All four walls were glass. It was a square room. There was room for little more than two people to sit, face-to-face. I was sitting there in a chair. I don't really know how I got in there. Jesus came in and went back out to find another folding chair. Then he came back in and sat with me. He was holding my hands. I asked him to be with Matthew. He said that they had arranged for him to spend time with Grandpa Fr. They were going to an amusement park. We sat there and talked. He kept holding my hands. I just kept saying, repeatedly, how sorry I was that I had so much difficulty being tolerant and forgiving of some people. I told him how much I disliked that about myself and how much I wish I could have done better, how hard it was, how sorry I was. Then I realized that I was going to be sent back - that I wouldn't remember any of it. I kept wondering if I could will myself to remember any of it. I didn't think that would be the case.

521,"Uncle A was there. I went and talked to him a couple of times. Towards the end I am with a group of women - maybe from CIIS, my cohort, but Susan J was there. We went to the dining room to have dinner. They are serving a spaghetti dinner. We have a platter of spaghetti and meatballs that we took from the main serving area to our table. I saw some other people were taking time to pray before their meal. We were waiting for some woman to finish taking her spaghetti off the platter. Susan J and I were talking about the fact that we always use the large plastic tongs, like they had here, at home because it makes serving spaghetti so much easier. The woman we were waiting for wasn't using them. When I took my turn I took all that was left. There 8 or 9 fairly large meatballs and quite a bit of spaghetti. As soon as I did it I realized that I shouldn't have done that because it was supposed to be shared by our table. I was very embarrassed but I didn't know what to do to make it right. We were now in another room. We were wearing roller blades. We were playing some form of indoor hockey. Instead of a puck we had a red plastic ball about the size of a grapefruit. It had holes that looked similar to the holes in a bowling ball but they had a bottom in them. They were the size of the holes in a bowling ball. You couldn't put your fingers in them. They were maybe an inch deep. I don't know if we were playing a game. We weren't doing very well. I think there was a man there that came up and told us that we should really be moving back and forth down the floor with the ball. I said that I can't skate that fast and with that being a ball I can't keep up with it to chase it down the floor. The others, I think, kind of agreed. Then I suggested that maybe we just need to keep our team members spread out far enough that no one of us has to keep up with the ball but rather just intercept and pass it on. There were two or three women who were just kind or practicing. They were spread out the way I had just suggested to our team. They made a goal. So my team realized then that it was a good idea and that we could do this.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-01-31),-0.28116497,-0.018879209,0.1393067,-0.27396584
522,"I was in a car with the President of the United States. It was someone other than George W. Bush. We were being shot at. I was now in my home. The same townhouse where I live in waking life. I was going outside but forgot to turn my alarm off, or I didn't turn it off on purpose before going outside. I stepped outside and heard what the alarm sounds like from the outside when it goes off. I thought, oh, that's what it sounds like from out here. I went back inside and turned it off. The police and Tim U, the maintenance man, showed up wanting to know what was wrong. I tried to reassure them nothing was wrong. I had to show them proof of who I was. A family that I didn't know pulled up in their car and at first they were just sitting out there. I wondered why they were there. The man got out of the car and the woman was sitting in the passenger side of the front seat. I noticed she was sobbing. The man came up to the police and me and tried to tell the police that I had hurt the woman's father. I don't know if she was claiming that I shot and/or killed him? I told them that I didn't. I think Rachel I from SDI was there now. She backed me up in assuring the police that I didn't even know the woman's father. I am inside now but it is now an apartment building. I seem to be an observer rather than participant now also. Two people from the TV show ER lived there. It was John Carter and Abby. There were also two couples who lived in our building that we knew. Both partners of both couples were obese. Them, Abby, and John were going to go use the hot tubs together. The couples, or at least some of those four people, had arrived at the hot tubs as had Abby. Someone came in and hurt Abby and put her head underwater. I knew she wasn't dead but I knew that John needed to show up quickly to save her. One of the couples might have been the couple that had accused me of hurting her father. It seems that maybe they thought Abby supported my innocence so they were taking their anger out, in retaliation, on her.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-02-01),-0.21581845,-0.26906422,0.08186969,0.29960328
523,"I was at the CAS office. They were on a boat. The wood slats of the boat had gaps, at least the ones higher than water level had gaps between. The gaps were about what you would see in a fence. So I could see between them. Bill C's office was set behind and above Haley N's and mine. Ours were side by side. I had overslept so I got to work late. My hair was very wet and I wasn't dressed. I just had a towel wrapped around me. I was trying to move around very gingerly so I wouldn't drop my towel and so Bill C wouldn't see anything. Haley N had left. I was reaching into something to try to get the key to my office. I did that. There was something, maybe a bathroom stall, in between my office and Bill C's office. I slipped in there to get dressed. There were actually two of them. I used the one to the right because I was afraid if I used the one to the left Bill C would see me getting dressed. I went into his office. He had Valentine decorations up. I was thinking about the fact that he is very good about seasonal decorations put up on a very timely manner. Then I realized it was Jane C that does that. I heard a radio ad playing. I don't remember what it was for. But when I went to the offices on the boat, I went into Haley N's office for something and she had left her radio playing. The same ad was playing. I was wondering if Bill C had heard that ad. It had something to do with us but I don't know if it was one of our ads or a client that had used our services. I actually think it was someone who had hired me to do a dream lecture, but maybe it also had something to do with CAS. I don't know. When I heard it I thought, oh, they haven't called me in awhile. They haven't hired me in a while. There was something about my relationship with Haley N and it being too late for me to make it better. Bill C was kind of fed up. He asked me to say something into a recorder. He said he was so sick of hearing voices - that he had interviewed so many people. I said, interviewed so many people? I don't understand. Why? He said, Because I have to get ready to fire you. I started begging him not to. He started going over results since I had been there. He was pointing out that I hadn't gotten any results. He said my performance was just okay. I said, Well I don't disagree that I haven't gotten results. I don't think it is due to my lack of effort or ability. I have tried everything that I know to try. I have asked you what to do differently. So, I really don't think it is fair that you would let me go because of that. What I didn't point out to him that his on-going change of direction, inability to focus and stay focused on one goal, or reluctance to make decisions were the primary factors that prevented the company from growing last year. I was getting very upset and beginning to cry. He was getting upset and teary. I was just begging him not to let me go.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-02-04),-0.2666008,-0.032249197,0.031006234,-0.056971565
524,"I had gone to this place. I don't know how I got there or why I went there. It was packed with people. They were dancing. I realized that it was also, a Laundromat. It was a huge room and it was filled with single people who were there to socialize with other singles while doing their laundry. Once a week they have an event there, well maybe it wasn't all singles. People would go there to socialize and do their laundry at the same time. I felt uncomfortable being there because I didn't know anyone. I found a table and sat down. I glanced over and saw this man sitting there looking at me. He had on a baseball hat. He was a little rough looking. I averted my eyes but saw out of the corner of my eyes that he had gotten up and was coming over to me. He grabbed another empty chair and pulled it up and sat down across from me. He asked if it was okay if he sat and talked with me. We talked very briefly. I felt very uncomfortable. Fortunately, shortly after he sat down the music ended and it was time to go home. As I was getting ready to leave I saw Margie D and Dennis D there. Dennis D had lost alot of weight. I said something to him about it, about how good he looked. He noticed that I had lost weight also. I said, Thanks, but I have a feeling that you have lost alot more than I have. Not that you had more to lose. I realized that sounded bad and I was embarrassed. He said, No, I did lose quite a bit. I don't know if he told me how much he lost. He had to have lost alot, well over 75 pounds. I think they were involved in hosting this event. I was helping them clean up and such. While I was doing that I was picking at the snacks. I think it was Doritos. I picked up some bags that I was going to help them put away. As we were walking out to our cars I realized I still had the bags of snacks in my arms. I felt really bad. I was embarrassed. I didn't know what to do. I just decided to put them in my car and bring them with me when I come back the next time. Now I am at home, on Lakeland Dr. I'm talking to Margie D and Dennis D. I said that it is very unusual that now that we live on the same street like we had planned, we hardly ever see each other. There was a stairwell. I was going down the steps and I realized that I had gone down one or two flights to far. I saw through the door window that it was at street level. But I realized that it was a different street level than our houses are. So I went back up to go out. We're back at this laundromat the next week. There aren't many people there yet. Dennis D Jr. walked up to me. He had on a winter coat. I said, Now isn't that something? He hardly knows me. He has only seen me once or twice before. But he comes up to me as though I'm an old friend. Margie D just smiled and said, Yeah, he's like that. I was helping them get ready. There was a stepladder. We were hanging things. I decided to go ahead and get my laundry started. I put my bed linens in the washer. Then the place started filling up with people. There wasn't any music yet. I wondered when the music would start. I thought it was curious that people weren't bringing their children. I didn't find it odd that Margie D and Dennis D did. As the place started filling up with people, some women had put their things on top of the washer I was using. I had forgotten about them until I saw that. I decided that I should go check on my laundry. I told them that I needed to switch my laundry. They were helping me to take the bed linens out but they were really wet, as though they had not even spun-dry. I didn't think alot about it. I just decided it would take them longer in the dryer. But before I put them in the dryer I was putting the next load in the washer. It was a load of dress clothes. After I closed the washer I realized that I had put the sheets back in there also. I had leaned over to start the washer and realized that the sheets hadn't washed at all. The washer had stopped after it filled with water. I didn't wash them together because I had just dyed the sheets and I didn't want the dye to ruin my dress clothes. I opened the washer back up and was digging the sheets out. Margie D came over and I explained to her what happened. She was helping me dig my sheets back out. The other women gave me a dirty look and I explained to them what happened but I didn't know what. Then they eased the way they looked at me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-02-04),-0.14048429,-0.25902626,-0.12529166,-0.082612716
526,"Some members of my family were here in the city where I live. We were somewhere downtown at a convention facility, maybe a hotel with large meeting rooms. There was something about refreshments sitting outside the meeting rooms. Later there was a discussion about CIC and I told them that if I had known they had never been there I would have taken them. Later, We were helping someone move. I asked Bob F how it is that it seems that every year we are helping someone in the family move. He said that last year it was me. I didn't say anything but mentally I was questioning that because I didn't think I had moved last year. There didn't seem to be a lot of things that we were moving and I don't know who it was that we were helping to move. Someone brought in a small red duffel bag. Mother rushed over to it, opened it up and pulled out a red zippered sweatshirt and put it on. I said, Oh, Mother is happy now. She's been waiting to get her sweatshirt back. I was now doing some kind of housework type thing in one of my bathrooms. There were brown spots all over the shower tiles. I realized that I really needed to make time to clean the house good. I think I said that to someone. Brian F brought me a very large greeting card. I opened it up. It said something to my Godmother. As I read it, I realized that it was a Christmas card written for a Mom, but that Brian F had changed it to Godmother and written in phrases of his own in between what was already printed. I didn't say anything about what I noticed. I just smiled and let him know that I appreciated it. He took it back and then came back a minute later. He had formed it into the shape of a Christmas tree and had placed it around a roll of toilet paper to give it stability to sit on a coffee table. I found that he had taped it to the roll of toilet paper when I picked it up to look at it. Now it had been turned inside out, but still in the same shape. However, now it looked like something for Valentine's Day. It had pink and red things all over it. Maybe hearts and cupid and such. I turned it back around the other way and set it back down on the table. Then I was in my car with someone and we went to the car wash at 65th St. and B1 Blvd. I wasn't sure if it would be open. I was concerned that there would be a very long line of cars there because the weather had just warmed up enough for people to get their cars washed. There was a long line but I was feeling patient so decided to just wait. A woman was driving away, towards us. She was in an older red car - kind of a sporty looking car - something that a teenager might have driven in the 50's or 60's. The car seemed to still have a lot of soap on it. She rolled down her window and was complaining because they didn't have anymore hot water. I thought this seemed reasonable given the number of cars that were going through the wash today. She was a bit upset about it. Someone else, outside both of our cars, was involved in the conversation as well but I don't remember who it was or what they were saying. I was still going to get in line and wait. I thought whatever the car wash would be better than nothing at all. Father Eric was telling us about some big ceremony that he was officiating at church and that he had to leave for that event. I decided to go as well. As Father Eric stood at the front of the aisle facing the people I was sitting behind him and to his left. The church was packed with people. Bill C and his wife got out of a pew, came up to stand next to Father Eric and to his right. Then I saw Terry D and his wife, Ann D, get up and stand to Father Eric's left, but then they moved over to his right. I think they stood in front of Bill C and Jane C. There seemed to be 3-4 children who also got up and stood in front of Terry D and Ann D, as well as some other people who got up at that point. I was surprised to see Bill C and Jane C in a Catholic Church. I was thinking to myself that I didn't know they were Catholic. I wasn't so surprised by Terry and Ann D because I had wondered if they were Catholic. Father Eric led a procession around the church. I am now sitting to one side of the church, maybe not, maybe a reception area now. I am facing the front. The areas are not all clearly visible as there are lots of plants and things sitting around that seem to offer privacy to some seating areas. I was sitting there with Bill C and Jane C, Bill C's Dad and some other member's of Bill C's family. At first I think the ceremony involves Bill C but later I think it was celebrating Bill C and Jane C's 25th wedding anniversary. There is an odd shaped table between Bill C and myself. I am too his left. The base is like a rectangular box, about the height of a coffee table. The top, however, is shaped like a roof. It is the same color as my living room tables. Jane C is sitting to the right of Bill C and his family members are facing us. I got up to move and had to move carefully because the top lifted a bit off the table when I tried to move my chair. I moved my chair away from the table first and then I moved to a different seat, where Bill C was at angle behind and to my right. We were now eating something - maybe cake. Someone said something to me about doing or not doing something for Bill C. I said, I would likely do it because I do work for him. They were teasing me mostly, and I felt a bit unsure how to respond. I usually do things for Bill C without question, or without much question unless it is something I am strongly opposed to. I do not think I would do something that I felt was morally wrong, though I can't imagine him asking me to do something like that. This was a minor little thing. It almost seems that I brought him a piece of cake but someone else thought he shouldn't have it and that's what this was about. Bill C was just smiling about the whole thing. I was then walking out with someone behind me. I'm thinking it might have been Father Eric or Bill C. Now we were at a hospital. I saw Doctor C. At first I just said hello, but then walked up to him and opened my arms, keeping my elbows at my side and pointing my arms straight out in front of me to give a not so obvious indication that I wanted a hug, the way I often do with Matthew. He gave me a lukewarm hug, not like he normally would, because I was with someone - Father Eric or Bill C. After we hugged I realized they might have thought it was odd or inappropriate. As we were walking away I explained that I used to work for Doctor C and we had become very close work buddies. There was nothing more to it than that. We still talk occasionally and sometimes I stop to see him at the Sleep Center. It seems that I may have looked into his office and saw him working as I walked away.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-02-06),-0.30132508,-0.16250479,0.11929482,-0.11341233
532,"I was part of a Spanish family. It was important that the women in the family did exactly what the men asked of them. If a woman did not, they could decide to have her killed. I decided that this was no longer an acceptable way to live so I was going to leave. I wanted my husband to come with me but he refused. He did not want me to leave, but felt his first loyalty was to the larger family. The family found out what I was planning so they decided to have me killed. I knew that I would now have to sneak away, so I could escape before they killed me, and so they would not know where I went and be able to come and find me. I had gotten into a white convertible with a female friend of mine. Trying to get in the front seat was difficult as it was not like most cars. There was just a small space for your legs, which had your legs lying straight out in front of you. I had to lift up a small flap of rubber and put my legs in and try to fit them in. I was thinking how I uncomfortable it was. It was somehow related to this, or at this time, that I decided that I should leave the family. I was packing my things in a large piece of furniture on rollers. As I was packing my husband came up and was going to help me get away safely. I asked him to come with me but he said he couldn't. After I was packed we were rolling the furniture to a place that looked like a furniture store. There was more than one store but I recall thinking that one in particular would work well because my furniture would blend in better than in the other store. Having made that decision I asked my husband to come with me, but he said he couldn't. I knew he did not want to be separated from me, yet he could not leave the family. He turned and began to walk away. I called to him several times, begging him not to go. I was saying was pleading with him, please come back. I repeated this several times. At one point he did stop walking, turned around, and looked at me. I could tell he was very sad. But he turned and continued walking away.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-02-10),-0.1257298,-0.24051759,0.051879648,0.0056808293
536,"I was driving to take something to Vince P and Sue P. They weren't where they used to be. Someone gave me directions to where they are living now. I couldn't believe it. It was in the poorest part of town. They were living in a little shanty, with no windows. It was a mess, with stuff everywhere. They were looking a little rough also. I hesitated to go any further because I didn't want them to be embarrassed. On the other hand, I didn't want them to think it was a big deal to me either. They seemed to welcome me easy enough. Twice while I was there I had to use the bathroom. Then it seemed as though all these little shanties shared a bathroom that had maybe three or four stalls. The stalls didn't have walls. It was all open. I just made sure I locked the door when I went in. I don't remember why I was there. I saw Steve B and Valerie B come in. I was talking a little to Valerie B. I said that this must be very difficult for her. She said that it was and that it made her fairly angry that they had done this to her business. Someone said something about the way they were living now and my coming there. I said that it doesn't really bother me at all. I told them that I have a sister that lives in a situation somewhat similar to this. I said the only thing that bothers me is that I am concerned that the person who lives here might feel uncomfortable to have me come here, that they might be embarrassed.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-02-12),-0.3487427,-0.06695453,0.18982646,-0.06958221
543,"I was at the SVSDC. I was a member of the management team. We were discussing doing a remodel, as we needed more offices. The patient rooms were set up more like a typical hospital wing. They lined both sides of a long hallway. I was working with a gentleman named Andy, but I don't know if he actually worked there, if he was a consultant or maybe he was a new employee. Andy and I were moving artwork from the walls. I was taking it down and setting it on the floor. He was taking some of it and moving it all to one hook on a wall. At first I thought he was simply rearranging it then I realized what he was doing. There were alot of storage cabinets. I was going through them, at some woman's request, to see what we might be able to get rid of. Doctor C came in and I was asking his thoughts on some of the things that I thought we could get rid of. The woman had wanted us to get rid of some things that Doctor C felt we should keep. The cabinets were all hanging on the walls a little higher than my head. I had to reach up to open them and try to reach the things inside to see what was actually there. The cabinets opened from both sides of the wall so you could access the things inside from the patient room or from the other side of the wall. At least some of them weren't very deep, and I recall that at least some of them just had two shelves in them. In one cabinet in particular I found some children's books. They were thick like adult paperbacks, yet they were stories for children. When I saw them I realized that those cabinets must open into the children's rooms. Doctor C was standing there with me. We were kind of laughing about not agreeing with the woman who had instructed me to clean them out. When I was looking to see what else was in the children's cabinet the books began to fall over and I was having trouble getting them to stand. We started laughing again. For some reason I wanted or felt I needed to get into some of the patient rooms. I opened one of the doors to what I thought was an empty room and found that it was now occupied. I saw a nurse and asked her which rooms were empty. She said they were now all occupied. I was surprised and a bit frustrated because this prevented me from doing what I wanted to do. Someone told me that many of the patients were there because they were recovering from gum surgery.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-02-16),-0.25286344,-0.041869875,0.06417267,-0.10494048
544,"I had gone to Kroger late one evening to pick up a couple of things. The parking spaces were parallel to the front of the store. The end of the row was even with the left frame of the door. There was a space open close to the end of that row. I pulled up and zipped into that space. As I did this I saw other people very upset, some milling around and some leaving. I noticed that the store was completely dark and closed. Then I saw a sign on the door that said the store was closed due to someone accidentally shooting someone as a result of trying to help them. I think there was at least one person lying on the ground. There were police officers there and they had taped off an area with the yellow tape that we see at a crime site. I think they have covered up one body. I think there were emergency vehicles there as well. I went ahead and got in my car. To leave I had to drive into the taped off area and then back out again.

I started off through the woods at one point and Matthew stopped me. He said that was not the path, that if we went that way we would be in danger. I don't know if he said something about bears or if that's just what I thought. As we were walking we saw some children sledding. However, they were sledding down a stream of water. I thought that was a bad idea because I was afraid for their health. I hoped they would go straight home from there and get dry and warm. We saw another woman with children there. Matthew told me that he wanted to go home. Where we were must have been a separate getaway that I owned. He was only the size of about a 12-year-old. However, I asked him if he wanted to go home because he wanted to go up and see Ashley B. He admitted that he did. I was concerned because that would be alot of driving. It's an hour and a half home, then another hour plus to Lafayette and then yet another almost two hours to Ashley B's. I know he has driven that long at once before but I was still concerned.

He couldn't talk to me or he wouldn't because he was with Ashley B and she didn't want to see me or talk to me because she was embarrassed about what happened. I decided that I at least wanted to take their child with me. They had a baby named Billy. I wanted to take Billy with me. Then there was another man there with me, to help me. Matthew and I were alone talking. I was telling him how very concerned I was about him getting back together with Ashley B and how concerned I was that he had taken off for New York and that after our last conversation he didn't call me back to let me know what was going on or how he was doing. Now someone else was there too. I had left Billy with them - for them to watch him. They were going to do something that was just going to take a couple of seconds so they handed Billy to someone that they thought was with us but it was a total stranger.

I think I told he and Ashley B to stay were they were and Matthew and I would go try to find Billy. I don't know if we ever did. We were back at our home. Matthew and I were talking about him going back to school.

The Koala bear was sitting in the bathroom and it's fur was stuck all over the bathroom floor. I think another stuffed animal was the same way. The floor was just really nasty.

One of the employees was Cameron Mannheim from a TV show about attorneys. I suspect that it is a law office but I don't think it was because of her. There is also a baby at the office. I think the baby belongs to one of the employees. We are watching the baby while the employee is away. I'm the one that gets stuck changing all of the diapers. No one else seems willing. I couple of times I picked the baby up and felt the diaper and realized that he needed to be changed. The baby's name is Brian. My brother Brian F is in one part of this dream. I am pointing to each of them saying, Big Brian, little Brian. I said it a couple of times, as if I am introducing them to each other but I say it more than twice. I leave the baby in the kind of seat that you lay newborns in. I thought I had left him with Cameron - that she was going to watch him for a few minutes. When I went back to Cameron to get him he wasn't there. She said, What do you mean where is he? I just walked away for a minute. I panicked prior to that thinking that I might have walked away without making sure that Cameron was going to watch him for me. When she said that I was reassured that she had agreed to keep an eye on him. We panicked because he wasn't there. We started going to all of these rooms or offices to look for him. Alot of these rooms were two rooms in one. The first room was small, maybe 8 ft by 8 ft. At the back of the room was a door to another room that was an even smaller square. We would go in each, open both doors to check and the moving on to the next. We were going all over. Cameron had gone into one room and a man came out. I think there was a meeting with some attorneys going on in that room. This man had on a white shirt with a tie. He was balding, short, small frame. He said, well, we may have what you're looking for. Then another attorney came out holding little Brian. He said, We just thought you might like a break from watching him. I'm thinking, Well that's great but you don't just take him without telling anyone. He had him bundled up in a blanket and hat and such. I wondered why he had him so bundled up because we were indoors and it wasn't cold.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-03-02),-0.16470401,-0.12856875,-0.07275392,-0.049812157

I realized that I had my hair in a ponytail. I didn't think mine was swinging around as much but mine wasn't as long either. She was very clumsy and not moving very quickly. There wasn't room for me to get around her and I was getting frustrated. I wanted her to get out of the way so I could really start running. I was in the backseat with Matthew and Chris H. Three of their friends were in the front seat. I was feeling very sleepy so I leaned over and rested against Matthew. I don't know if I really slept or if I was just half-asleep.

I think he hit both of the very large women. They both fell underwater. John and Abby were going to dive down and try to help them and bring them up. When they went down they got stuck on something. When John and Abby went down they got them both out but in doing so Abby got stuck. Her head was in something that looked like a steering wheel. John went back down and was able to get her back out. We are all indoors. I think we work here. There had been one CD playing in a CD changer that held about 12 different CD's. This CD was somehow related to the shooter. Maybe he knew something because of this CD. I started adding other CD's to create confusion. I just added a few at a time. Now I am outside. Somehow because of the CD's I could identify him, or maybe adding the other CD's was making it more difficult for him. At the same time I am making it easier for us to identify him. He came by and I knew it was him. He knew it was me that was putting the CD's in there. It was making him angry. I don't know if it was because it was making something more difficult for him or because it was making it easier for him to be identified. I threw one CD disc at him like a Frisbee. It missed him. I think he threw a couple at me, but those were in jewel cases. I realize he is now after me so he cannot be identified. Everyone there knew that I was the next target. Because of that I could help catch him by making myself even more of a target. We had put these other CD's in the CD changer. I had become very upset, emotionally or mentally, about this whole thing. My doctor had prescribed some medication for me. I took one or two of those. We knew this man was coming back again. Now where we work is a police station. Michael J. Fox is one of the police officers. There was another officer there as well. He was a black man. He did not want to be part of trying to get this man. We were sitting in this officer's house, in his bathroom. Michael J. Fox was talking to him about a bathtub in there. He said, Come on, you know you're so close to retirement. You've been working on fixing up this house. You've got this one last project. You want to get that tub replaced and fixed up. You want something much nicer. This will be the last ticket before you retire. He had convinced this officer, although he was still reluctant, to help us catch the shooter. We were preparing to do something that was going to be very dangerous. We were sure this was going to allow us to catch him. I didn't want any part of it either. I was afraid because I knew I was his primary target now. Michel J. Fox convinced that for that reason I was the key to catching him. He said they really needed me to do that. He was putting the responsibility on me to keep this man from hurting other people. They couldn't catch him without me or something to that effect. My participation would allow them to catch him before he hurt anyone else. I reluctantly agreed but I was thinking, I don't care. I've taken my drugs. I was in a mental fog from the drugs. They gave me two belts to put on. One might have been a gun belt. The other also had something on it but I don't know what. They positioned me lying on the floor inside a doorway to the outside. We were on the roof of the building. I looked outside and there was a young woman walking across the roof. She was a younger woman. She looked like Janice on the TV show Friends. She was wearing animal print clothing on and high heels. She had long, full, wavy, dark hair. We knew that she was his marker. She had been acting as though she was lost or looking for someone. She was actually looking for me so she could tell the shooter where I was. She did see me lying right inside the door. At that point we knew we were set, that he would come up there to shoot at me inside this door. Michael told me to stay put while he went downstairs. He was going to try to shoot the man before he ever got up to the roof.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-03-02),-0.16835175,-0.124827385,0.0924821,0.046655398
561,"I was part of an extremely dysfunctional family. There were two daughters. One was about 11-12 and the other 7-8 years of age. They were extremely belligerent to their mother, and disrespectful and don't do anything they are asked, etc. They're dressed absolutely awful. I finally told them that they are going to get cleaned up and changed. I gave the first one an hour in the bathroom and the next one an hour. And I tell them that they will come out looking and the way their mother and I would like them to look. Initially they were very sassy and sarcastic in interpreting what that meant. Once they got started they yelled out into the kitchen a question and their mom started to respond real sassy. I said, No. Stop. Answer them in a different way. So then she was very nice about how she answered. When they came out they looked very nice and respectable. They had done a really good job. A bunch of us were in the kitchen preparing dinner. BJ was there. I think this must have been BJ's house. She had two stoves. They were each on separate yet adjoining walls. So it was hard to use. I was sitting on the floor with the youngest girl. They opened both ovens at once. I grabbed her and held her very still to make sure she wouldn't get burnt by both of those doors opening at once on either side of her. I told her how dangerous that was. They said something about my kitchen. I said, Well, I just have one stove. I do my baking in it. Then they were fixing steak and baked potatoes for dinner. But we were eating everything except the steak first because the steak wasn't done yet and they had just fixed a couple of baked potatoes. They were cutting them up and giving each person just a little bit of each one. That was fine with me because the potatoes were way too big for me to eat a whole one myself. A little bit after that they were still in the kitchen and I was sitting in another room with the husband. The mom and someone else was canning green beans. I called the little girl to come out there with us because I didn't want her to get burnt. Those canning jars and the steam from the canners can get so hot. I was concerned that she would get scalded. We heard a timer go off so we knew that some of the jars were done. The mother brought a couple of them in to show us. It had not worked. The jars had not sealed and the beans and something else that she was canning looked very odd. Everybody was upset because it didn't work. All this produce was going to go to waste. Then we went to a swimming pool. I don't think this was the same family. We saw another family come. They had two male adults that were about 4 feet 11 inches in height. They both had a number of severe mental and physical disabilities. The one, I said, Oh no. That's the one that has that really, loud, obnoxious laugh. I was thinking about leaving. Then as they were getting ready to go in the pool I noticed that the other one, one of them was getting ready to tell him he couldn't get into the pool and he was pointing out that he had on some kind of swimming diaper that was going to make it okay. He had this thing wrapped around his head, including his face. It looked kind of like plastic but when they pulled it off his face was so completely disfigured. It was almost as though you couldn't see eyes, a nose, or a mouth. I was trying very hard not to look. They took the plastic off and then put the plastic back on and conformed it to his face to make it look more as though he had a normal face. They just laid the plastic back on. They asked me to help and I felt very uncomfortable and I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable because I didn't know what I was doing and such. I said something to that effect. He just took my hand and shook it and said thank you, as if to say that was nice of you too, to just acknowledge that.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-03-04),-0.33321232,-0.10422413,0.15489507,-0.15411519
562,"I went to the barn to get my horse. I was going to ride him but I think I also wanted to get him for someone else. I was holding the reins and he kept going around in circles, tangling the reins and making it impossible for me to get on him. I finally got him to stop. I untangled the reins and was walking him over to the other person. There was a place that the grassy area ended and a wooded area began. In the woods the ground cover was something besides grass but I can't describe what, except that it was brown. I stepped into the wooded area with the horse and noticed a snake. I decided to quickly get him out of there because I know snakes can frighten horses. As I began to leave the wooded area I saw lots and lots of snakes. Some were by themselves and in other places there were bunches of them together. I'm afraid of snakes so I was feeling very anxious and wanted to get out of there quickly. I stepped over at least one snake to get out of there. I told someone about all of the snakes in the wooded area. For some reason I took the horse into an expensive restaurant. It seems that maybe it was a shortcut to where I was going. I wasn't being very careful. I didn't think I needed to be. So I didn't have a very short hold on the reins. I was kind of letting the horse lead me and move where he wanted to in the restaurant. Someone working in the restaurant got upset with me so I took the horse back out. I was standing inside a building and it began to rain. We were in California. The grass was very brown. Everyone was excited that it was raining because it doesn't rain there very often and we really needed it. The rain was coming down very hard. There were several sculptures in the grass. At least I think they were sculptures. They were made of a very lightweight metal, maybe aluminum. They were various shapes like a ball, a multi-sided star, maybe an octagon. I can't recall how many different ones there were. As the rain came down some of them began to move or blow away. I ran out into the rain and stopped at least one of them at least once. I think I put something into the bottom of one of them to try to keep it in place. The water was beginning to collect on the ground. I don't know if it was collecting on the grass or on the cement. I was thinking about the fact that it was doing that. Maybe I was concerned that it was a problem but I can't recall why it was a problem.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-03-09),-0.10196617,-0.1376604,0.026321892,0.14862944
564,"I was in a house that I lived in with 3-year-old Matthew. It was the middle of the day. We were outside. Matthew was riding his big wheel. I was walking while he was riding. We had gone quite a little distance. He had asked me something and then I turned away from him. When I turned back I couldn't see him anymore. Even though it looked like a straight view as far as I could see in all directions around me, I couldn't see him anywhere. I just panicked. I started running and yelling and calling out his name. I couldn't find him. I finally decided I didn't want to walk away yet. I knew that I couldn't move very fast this way because I was walking. I finally decided to go back to the house and get the car and drive to find him. So I went back to the house and got my keys. I was dressed for work. I went outside to get in the car and there he was - sitting there on his big wheel, looking as though he knew he was in trouble and he was so dirty. Before I could say anything, he was talking - as though he was alot older than three - you didn't even have to say it. I've been yelled at by, I don't know whom, but these other people already yelled at him. So I didn't say anything right away. I picked him up and held him but out away from me because he was so dirty and I didn't want to get my work clothes all dirty. I took him in the house and thought about sitting him down but he was so dirty and I didn't want to get the dirt all over the carpet. So I took him into the bathroom and was going to just sit him right in the tub. It was as if he was cooperating with his body. I said okay fine. So when I actually went to sit him down he ended up on his stomach and kind of sliding down. But then he ended up sitting up.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-03-12),-0.17096108,-0.3229096,-0.23525707,0.28895926
568,"I was at USC. I was sitting in a room working at a computer. It was at a table with a high stool type chair. There wasn't much room. There were rows of table without much room between them. I was sitting there working at the computer and I noticed out of the corner of my eye that Ben D was trying to sneak up behind me. I turned around and saw him. He came around the other side of the table and said, Hi Sweetie. We hugged. We chatted very briefly then he turned and walked away to put something in his office. His office was not very far away. He was wearing navy blue sweat pants and a striped shirt and tennis shoes. As he came back out, I was stretching and rubbing my eyes because I had been looking at the computer screen so long. He said something about that. I said I just forgot to bring my eye drops with me. I said I should probably go try to get some. He told me where the nearest drug store or something was. He said, Of course, they're going to be getting ready for the St. Patrick's Day parade now. Then he was saying something about the fact that they don't get as many people coming in there as they used to because they're located in a small strip center. The big strip centers are in other locations and not as many people come in there as used to.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-03-16),-0.16342327,-0.13677108,-0.32558426,-0.04145712
571,"I was working at the CAS office. The office was a little bit different. Not alot but a little bit different than in waking life. It was primarily Bill C and I working there. I don't think there was anything about Haley N. Blair K did come to mind during the dream. Bill C had just come back from a meeting with an accountant maybe. One of the accountants came with him, a woman. It might have been Lydia from SDI. Anyway, he came back and went into his office and closed his door. Lydia was still at the office but I don't know where. I saw two men standing at the front desk so I went out to see how I could help them. It turned out that one of them was Vince P. I went to the counter and as I looked up and asked if I could help them I realized this. I said, Vince P! He looked up and was also surprised to see me. We hugged. I asked him where he has been and what had happened to him. I told him that I had tried to call him and left messages and he didn't return my call. He said he had just been so busy. He didn't say much else. He introduced me to the man that he was with and said they were there to buy some books. I asked him if he wanted just books or sets. I explained that the CD was not the entire book but a companion CD. They decided that they did want sets. I asked how many. They mentioned a couple of quantities and I think they finally decided on 66 sets. I told them that it would take me a few minutes to get them together. They said that was fine, that they would wait. I went in back and started getting the sets together. Lydia came back and was talking to me about the fact that they were going to start making financial cutbacks. What this meant to me was that they weren't going to do the e-articles. I got really upset. I said, I don't understand that because there is no additional cost involved. She started to talk and tried to justify it. I didn't want to hear it. We were silent for a little while. I finally said, Lydia. Really. Help me to understand this because there is no additional cost involved in these. There is no printing, no proofing, no creation cost. I just don't get it. She said, We've just been overspending. I don't know if I just thought this had something to do with Blair K or if she actually said something. I thought, yeah. Here we go again. Bill C has gone way out on a limb. He's made this commitment to Blair K. I didn't think he should do it and I'm the one that is paying for it again. I was really upset by this. So we quit talking about it again. I was trying to get the sets of books ready for Vince P. I was pulling books out of the cabinet. I realized that some of them were used and were in really bad shape. I was aggravated at that point because someone had put these really crummy books in there. Then I realized that they weren't all BCB. That some of them were different types of books. I was trying to sort out the ones other than BCB. I didn't want to give these really bad, tattered ones to Vince P. I wanted to make sure that I only gave him nice, new ones. I was wondering how they were going to carry all of these. I found two boxes that were folded up. Lydia was helping me. She taped the bottoms of the boxes up and then she boxed them for me as I completed each set and then taped the boxes closed. When I actually got ready to take them up front, now instead of in boxes they were in these two large plastic things that were shaped like some kind of bird. The top was kind of like the head of the bird and it twisted on and off. There were two of them. I picked them up by the necks of the birds. She sprayed one and was wiping it off because it looked kind of dusty. I grabbed them by the neck and took them out front to Vince P. When I did that there were 4-5 women standing out there now also. I took care of Vince P. It seemed that at least one of the other women was also a DDSI person. I recognized her and knew her name. I grabbed some forms that were lying at the front desk but then I excused myself and went and got some regular product order forms. I started filling in the form. She gave me her name and I didn't tell her that I already knew who she was or that I remembered her or recognized her. I asked her to wait for one second and I went into Bill C's office. He was in there with 3-4 other people. They were watching TV. I stuck my head inside the door and said, Bill C, can you please come out and help me. There's like 4-5 people out here waiting. He didn't look at me. He lifted his hand and waved it at me as if to wave me away and said, yeah. Yeah. I'll be out in a minute. It was as though he didn't want to face me or talk to me. So I went ahead and went back out. I was talking to this woman. I think her name was Cindy [unknown in waking life] . She told me what she wanted but it was something for her car- like service on her car. There was a TV in the lobby and they were all watching TV. After she told me what she wanted she said, So, I'll just sit here and wait. I said, excuse me. You're in the wrong place. That's not what we do here. We're not an auto service place. We do sales training. She made some comment as though I was wrong. I just said, I'm sorry. That's just not what we do here. We do sales training. At that point I realized that they were all together and they got kind of irritated and left. Then I had some puppies at the office. One of them was real and one wasn't, yet they both were moving around as though they were real. I went to the box to let my puppy out. I said, I bet you're hungry. I bet you both are. I realized, or thought that I hadn't fed them for a day or two and I felt really, really guilty. Really Bad! I thought, well at least it won't be like soiling the carpet or anything because they were in their box and they had been going in there. So I was going to go feed them. They were really cute - all chubby and very, very soft and brown fur. Kind of reminds me of Sir Gallahad's fur.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-03-20),-0.014065138,-0.11767796,-0.3203504,-0.052595377
575,"I was on a college campus. Mother and Daddy were with me. We were going to be staying there for a couple of days. Daddy went up and talked to one of the administrators and was trying to make himself look good. However, when he thought he would suit him well he said that he was there for me and I felt that he used me. Mother and I were talking about that and kind of laughing, how he needs to make himself look important and if he thinks something will make him look like a good person in someone else's eyes then he will use me or someone else to do so. I said that it wasn't a problem, that it didn't bother me. I thought it was funny to watch how people do things like that. There were some male students were acting as hospitality ministers and greeting people, taking care of their luggage and things such as that. At first they couldn't tell us where our room was or where we would be staying. Then they did find out. I went there and find out that they were putting across a campus street in another building on campus. The room was 268. In the first room and I had lain down to take a nap. I had gotten a few things out. I had gotten out a can of a soft drink. I finally received notice that our other room was ready and they were going to be moving us over there. I got all of my things together and some other employees of the campus came in and were going to clean the room. I cleaned it up just enough that they would know that they needed to change the pillowcase because I had used the pillow. Then I heard one of the students talking to daddy about our luggage and saying, You'll know when your luggage is coming up. You'll hear it coming up. You'll hear something like two thumps, something like eleven times you would hear them. You would know then that your luggage was on your floor. Still, someone else would be there to get it and take it to our room. I went to the room and was looking for a soft drink. There was something like a can dispenser under a counter. I couldn't actually see the dispenser, however, until I started to pull it out. I started to pull one out and saw that it was orange juice. We were questioning whether we had packed too much or just the right amount. If it was just the right amount and it was the difference between being supportive and being an enabler. There was also something about some kind of contest which was also related to the luggage.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-04-08),-0.25718957,-0.14635101,-0.1286247,-0.10544072
577,"Bill C had just come back from vacation. We went to have lunch. When we walked in the restaurant we noticed that Blair K was there having lunch with someone. Bill C ducked behind a wall because he didn't want Blair K to see us. He wanted us to be able to have lunch alone and catch up on business issues. He wasn't sure how he wanted to deal with Blair K yet. He wasn't successful. Blair K had seen him and came up to us. He invited us to join them. Bill C just told him that we needed to catch up on business issues. Blair K returned to his table and the hostess seated us. We were sitting there eating at a six-foot long table. I was at the very left end of one side and Bill C was across from me, but in the second to last chair. There were people we didn't know seated next to me.

I don't know who the other CRHP sister was. It was though it was not a waking life CRHP sister. Theresa S and Stephen S sat down to my left at the end of the table. The other couple sat to Bill C's left. They were talking to each other, kind of across us. I introduced them to Bill C, though they didn't really seem to pay attention or acknowledged each other. I could tell by the look on Bill C's face that he was aggravated because he had wanted to discuss business with me. I was uncomfortable and not sure what to do. I finally leaned over to Theresa S and said, I'm really sorry. I don't want to be rude. But this is my boss and he had wanted this to be a working lunch for us. She apologized and said that was fine.

They are in there playing music but its kind of like hard rock or some such. Most of it I really don't like at all. BJ and I both go in. BJ says something to them about the fact that they have to play something that everyone can play. She then walks out. I jokingly say, and if you don't change, I'll be back in. As if to say, then you'll have to deal with me. I think Matthew, JC W, and Joshua Grayson, from the TV show American Idol, were three of them. I'm not sure if there was a fourth. I went up to Joshua. We were both standing facing in the same direction. I put my arm around his back, lean over, and say something to him. I don't know what, but I was joking with him. He just smiled a broad smile and laughed a little. I smiled back at him and then walked out. There are four astronauts inside a space capsule. There is a malfunction and two of them die. The other two are really struggling to hold on. One of them is Joshua G. They are floating inside in their spacesuits. They are holding on to the hatch. They are very, very cold. One of them is reaching, trying to get a little bit of air come through the hatch, as though that would warm them. Something happens in the capsule. I think part of it breaks off. They are now close to earth and in fact come in contact with the ground. They start scraping along the ground. They're very excited and shouting, Look. Grass. Grass. Right before that they said, Look we just passed someone's house. They just missed hitting the roof. They finally come out of the capsule. They don't know where they are but they do realize that they are at someone's home. They no longer have their spacesuits on. They are walking across this yard. There's family stuff, toys and such, strewn all over the yard. However, there is something in the yard that looks like large marshmallows and it sticks to their shoes. They have a little bit of trouble walking through that and trying to get whatever it is off of their shoes. They opened the door and knock as they enter. The family is sitting at the dinner table, eating a meal. Most of them seem surprised to see the astronauts. But the dad is a black gentleman that reminds me of Colin Powell. He doesn't seem surprised to see them. They are showing him something. They take the cover off. It almost looks like an Elmo doll with a spacesuit on. What they're taking off is the spacesuit. There is something very significant about that. They want to know what is significant about it. The dad won't answer. He just says something like, you don't need to know that. I'm left with the impression that they were part of some kind of covert government operation and they don't know what the operation was really about, and they weren't supposed to. But this dad, and this family, were part of it and did know what was going on. There is some kind of a TV show going on. One or both of these men are involved in this show. It's the holidays. There are five people on the set at one point. They begin trying to solve a puzzle. I realize that each person that is on the show that day represents one of the Twelve Days of Christmas song.

580,"I was to be in a fashion show for both the church and the apartment community. I was dressed in a black, floor-length gown that was just over one shoulder. It had a slit up the side and kind of along the side of the torso as well. Then it had little rhinestones on the part that goes up the shoulder of the bodice. They were both scheduled for the same night. There was also something else going on that night. I don't remember now what. I made the one for the apartment community and then I rushed to the church and I was too late for that one. Then I went back to the apartment community for some other things. They had some gifts for us. There was some discussion about lease renewal. Part of the dream it was daylight. It seemed that I was at the condo instead of the apartment community. I was working in the yard and there was this big piece of black something that was rolled up and someone was digging up part of the yard and unrolling it and was going to bury it there. That isn't what it was intended to be used for and I thought that was odd that it was how they were using it. I went back to the church and my car wouldn't start. I somehow moved it anyway. It was as though I picked it up and moved it and sat it alongside, by the rectory. There were three cars parked there. I kind of picked mine up and moved it to sit alongside those three, facing the same direction. Now it was dark and I went up to the back door and it was very rustic looking. Like the door and the walls almost blended together. There was no window or anything in the door. I rang the doorbell and there was a little window above the door where I could see if someone was coming or not. So I was kind of watching and it was like 9:00 and I felt bad that I was bothering them so late at night but I didn't know what else to do since my car wouldn't start. I was just going to ask someone if they could give me a jump. And Beth came to the door. She was wearing her pajamas. Of course she said she would be right out to help. I stepped inside the door while she went and got jumper cables and she came back kind of rushing. I apologized again for bothering her so late at night and I told her that I did know how to use the jumper cables. Then there were 3-4 steps coming out of the rectory. As we were coming down the steps I was explaining that I was in the fashion show there and that I was also supposed to be in a fashion show at the apartment community and had just too many things going on that night and I was rushing around and now my car wouldn't stop and I was just very apologetic.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-04-28),-0.123809256,-0.064419195,0.23076844,-0.112078965
582,"I was in a conference room with Bill C. We were having a meeting and he and I were sitting at the back right table. Someone else was leading the meeting. We had a number of visitors there. It seems that they were all women. The tablecloths didn't hang as well over the tables as they do in waking life and I noticed on the ends of the tables the actual metal part of the table was about 12 inches long, from the top of the table towards the floor. They were really dirty. They had something like hair clippings or cobwebs hanging. It was very disgusting looking. As soon as I noticed it I nudged Bill C and said, look at the end of the table two rows up. He looked at it and he was so disgusted that we were presenting ourselves this way, that we had allowed this happen and we had guests in and this was there. Shortly after I noticed it and pointed it out to Bill C there was a male child in the room as well. He had plugged in a hair dryer and he pointed the hair dryer at that mess and it just kind of blew up into the middle of the room, swirling around almost like a tornado. Everybody saw it. We were just horrified. The mother of the child tried to stop him. The other people in the room were kind of trying to act as though it wasn't a big deal. The child just kept doing it and the mother finally got the child under control. We took a break from the meeting to kind of get things back under control. I don't think we actually did anything. Bill C walked out of the room. I don't know where he went. I stayed for a little while. More people started coming in. It's as though we were now going to start a new meeting. I was in the room, talking to some of the different people. I started to head back towards my seat and someone said, Anna F. Don't I know you from somewhere? Do I know that name from somewhere? I briefly explained to her about my name change. I was going to explain to her about changing my first name but someone else came up and started talking to us, her primarily so I didn't get a chance to explain that to her. Then I decided to go out, I left the room and was going to use the restroom. The restroom door that I found didn't have a door handle. I reached down to the bottom of the door and pulled the door open that way. I went in and it was like a long tiled hallway, almost like a locker room. At first I was hesitant to go in because I knew that since the door didn't have a handle it obviously was not the right way to go in. But I really had to use the bathroom so I went ahead in. It was almost, it almost looked like a maze. I was trying to figure out where the stalls were or what stalls to use. I could tell there were people in there using some of them and someone actually stuck their head above one of them. I was embarrassed to be seen in there because I knew I wasn't supposed to be in there. So then I was trying to find my way out. Someone noticed that and I never did actually use the bathroom. Someone noticed that I was trying to find my way out and showed me the way out. I actually went out the way I came in. When I went out I was in a hotel. I wanted to find the elevator and leave the hotel. I was having trouble finding the elevator. For some reason I felt as though I wasn't supposed to be there or I didn't want to be seen. I didn't want anyone to know that I was trying to leave. Now it almost seemed as though I was in a well. I saw this religious sister. I think she was pushing a hospital bed that had someone in it. I saw her heading for this large size elevator that would accommodate hospital beds. I jumped into this elevator with her. She didn't really seem to question my being there or getting on this elevator with her. There were 1-2 other women on there as well, also religious sisters. They asked what floor. The one pushing the bed said she needed floor 53. Nobody else said anything. No one asked what floor I needed. I was just going to be quiet and hoped that they would all get off and that I could then go down and leave. So we went to floor 53 and two of them got off. I don't remember the hospital bed being there now. One of them was apparently going to floor 50 so she stayed on with me and started chatting with me a little bit. I was afraid that she was going to find out that I was trying to leave. Then there was like this somehow I don't think I said anything and I don't know if she suspected but now it was as though we were in this. It was like somebody that you couldn't see, or wasn't even there. Almost like something you would see in a movie scene or something like magic. Like somebody who wasn't present knew what was going on and knew that I was trying to leave. But this woman who wasn't present but who saw so to speak that I was trying to leave performed some kind of magic and she started transforming my appearance. My nails grew elegantly long and were very nicely manicured and polished. She changed what I was wearing to a very elegant yet it had something like shiny threads running through it. I think my hair became long also. When this started happening the women in the elevator with me realized what was going on and that I had been trying to leave. The person who was changing my appearance was doing this so I would be able to leave unnoticed. I was holding something when my nails began to change. There was also I'm backtracking here. I went through this bathroom thing more than once.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-02),-0.20108162,-0.029931437,0.06340153,-0.08531301
585,"A man was building a house or doing some remodels work. He was adding on to a patio. He had a lot of children, 10-12 maybe. It was a black family. They had a utility van that they used as a family car. All of the children were in the back. There was a wide age span. Some of them were close to Matthew's age. Some of them were very young. About half of them were asleep in the back of this van, kind of laying on each other. Some of them were sitting up against the side, where there was a side door. The mother was telling them not to lean on that door so they wouldn't fall out. They had come to this house. The ones that were awake got out and went to look at the patio or deck or whatever it was that he was building. From the grassy area he had created two levels of something like a decorative border. The border was small slats of something like a maple wood, varnished, that he was lying on top of each other and around. The look resembled that of butcher block. That one went in a little bit and then he did it again. So we went up to the actual level of the floor of the patio. He had poured old cement next to the old. There was one girl, probably around 18 to early 20's. Her name was Nicki T. It was almost as though she was Nicki T that worked for me at SFI. She walked on the new cement. There was something about her being the first one to walk on the new cement. I don't know if someone said that or if I just thought it. Then, some of them were walking off that cement down below. There was this really high pile of dirt that was maybe 12-13 feet high. On that pile of dirt was lots of lumber and things - building materials on this pile of dirt. Some of them were kind of walking along there, kind of on some of the lumber on the side of this pile of dirt. The lumber started to fall. I was concerned about them getting hurt but then another one went across. More lumber fell. Then the next one, something actually fell on him and knocked him over. He got right up and said he was fine. One of the things that had landed on him was a brown square box of something. But he got up right away and went on.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-07),-0.073653504,-0.012216267,0.088508114,0.08416208
586,"I went in to the CAS office. I was wearing my plaid flannel pants and a T-shirt. I went to the restroom. I felt really bad about how I looked. I wanted to hurry up and get out of there before anyone saw me. But when I went from the restroom I wanted to hurry back to my office and hoped that no one saw me. But when I got ready to walk back to the office I had to walk past two other offices and through one office. Of course, the receptionists in all three of those offices were all three women who were dressed very professionally. I think I went down there twice. The second time I realized I didn't have to go through the one office to get back to my office. There was a very narrow hallway behind the office walls. The wall was glass but at least I didn't have to walk through that office. When I went back the second time, when I got to the one office, the office was locked and all the lights were turned out. Earlier I had seen the receptionist fixing her hair and stuff. She had put some rollers in the front of her hair and taken them out. She was wearing a red business suit. When I came back the second time that office was locked, dark. Then I got to our office and the lights were all turned out. I worried for a second that Bill C had left and locked the door. Fortunately, he hadn't locked it. He had just turned the lights out. So I went in, turned the lights back on and went into my office.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-08),-0.19315057,-0.02982882,0.23067153,-0.07941372
587,I was going on a trip with a bunch of people I know. Maybe fellow students or maybe a business trip. I'm not sure which. The place we were staying was circular in shape and there were three floors and the to get to the floors it's like we were in the center. It wasn't all that big and kind of went to the outer edge of the circle. I don't know exactly how to explain it. It's like you kind of had to lie down on your back and slide through this opening to get to the hallway that led into the guest rooms. We had gotten to this place by bus. I was one of the last ones off the bus so most of the first floor rooms were gone when I got there. I had gone into a room and was thinking about just taking that room. It wasn't like a normal hotel where they assign you a room when you check in. While I was in there looking at this room someone else came in and just started unpacking. So I had to try to find another room. It was kind of difficult how you had to go through this opening to go to the different rooms. I did the same thing at the second floor and I found a room or two but for some reason I didn't like them and I didn't want to go up to the third floor. The second and third floor rooms were more difficult to get to than the first floor. I ended up going to someone in charge and explaining that I am really uncomfortable on the second and third floor. I explained what happened when I was in the one first floor room and someone else just came in and started unpacking. They said they normally reserve a couple of the first floor rooms for emergencies. They are nicer rooms than any of the others. They felt that this was a situation that warranted them giving me one of those rooms.,elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-09),-0.1635392,-0.032991156,0.2410883,-0.090904236
588,"I was at some kind of a show. It was being held outdoors. It was only for women. The performers, I think, were only women. There was something before the show. I think it was at a retail store. Some of us were shopping for clothing. These very tall, circular clothing racks. At the show they had brought out some kind of refreshments. It reminds me of like tomatoes and slices of turkey and ham. We were taking some of each and rolling it together. This show happened more than once. The second time somebody was saying, the entertainers were saying, that they left the food out of the refrigerator too long and she got ill from it. And somebody I was with said they did too. I said, well, the last time we may have left it out too long. But this time we didn't. This is weird because they hadn't brought it out yet but when they did bring it out I was having trouble rolling it this time. I don't remember what I ended up doing with it. There were a lot of black women at this program. After the program I am in the car with at least two other women. I have no idea who they were. We were driving and we stopped, I don't know where, I don't think it was in traffic. But we stopped somewhere for some reason and I had my window down. I saw this young black woman standing outside on the sidewalk. I finally realized it was Nicki T from SFI. I said, Nicki T? She said, Yes! She came over and we were talking. I was happy to see her. I asked her what she was doing now. She told me she was managing our store now. I was so excited for her. I leaned out the window and said, come here and give me a hug. I gave her a big hug and congratulated her and I said, What about your dating life now? She said she's been dating the same man for a year now and he's a really good man and he treated her really well. We just talked a little while. I told the people that we were with that we could go whenever they were ready. Then I told her that I needed to get going that I couldn't keep these women waiting. I said it was really good to see her and that I was very proud of her and I congratulated her again. She was proud and glad that I was proud of her. We pulled away and I was telling the women I was that it is people like that make the work that you do worthwhile. I tried to explain to them that she had been my assistant manager and I really had some difficulties with her. I really worked with her to get her act together. I saw alot of potential in her and had made her my assistant manager and was really working hard to teach her. I said I was really pleased that she had gotten her act together and that she was now the store manager and that she was now in a good healthy relationship.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-09),-0.29810575,-0.05504964,0.3159884,-0.20187895
590,"A bunch of the family was at Bob F's trailer. He and his family lived in this trailer. Bob F, Todd A, Bev, Rachel S and I were all there. I don't know who else. All of these people dressed in black, with black hoods over their faces, came running up outside the trailer. They had guns and surrounded the trailer. Someone said something about a certain song and that a certain song prompted them to come after us. Bob F called a radio station and asked them to play this song. Bob F turned it up very loud so they could hear it outside hoping it would make them leave. They didn't. They just opened fire. I was holding Rachel S. We were all running around, screaming. We didn't know where to go. We were trying to find a place to hide to avoid the gunfire. I felt the gunfire rip down my back. I heard someone yelling for Todd A. It didn't seem that any time had passed and I was walking around trying to find everyone. I kept saying something to Bob F and he wouldn't answer me. I reached up and touched his face and he just brushed it as though he had felt something. I realized then that I had died and that he couldn't see or hear me. I started walking through the trailer and I saw BJ. I said something to BJ and she turned around and said something to me. I said, Oh. You can see me. She said, Of course I can see you. Then I saw Bev. Bev made me realize that she had not made it either. At that point I realized that BJ was getting ready for our funeral. John S had survived but I don't know if he was there. Someone said that he was pretty much living in a daze now. He was being very technical. I realized that I had saved Rachel S. I started screaming and crying, I saved Rachel S. I saved Rachel S. I saved Rachel S. Bob F had survived. Somewhere along here Jennifer F came in. In listening to things I realized it was all her fault. Something she had done caused all these people to come after her and instead they ended up killing some many of us, but not her. Somebody said Bill F hadn't spoken since this happened. I thought that was additionally hard on Mother and Daddy. Apparently they had survived. I know that Bev and I died. But I don't know who else. I think Todd A did. I saw Rachel S and I called her. She was with Bev. Because she is so young she can see us and hear us. I went up to her and I said, Rachel S, come here. She came to me and I hugged her. But then she started coughing. I said something to somebody or somebody said something. She was getting sick and if they didn't hurry she would die. Somebody, some emergency workers, took her and put her on a stretcher. There was some man there that could talk to the dead. He was talking to the emergency workers and to Bev.

591,"I was with two other people. We had these things about the size of a credit card. They were in two pieces. We would put them together with our arms stretched up in the air, and it would lift us up into the air and through an opening in the ceiling. We had to be standing in just the right place. We had to find the right spot on the ceiling. The ceiling in this place was a wood ceiling. I don't know if we were looking for something. Someone said something about us going there to get our share. After it lifted us through we would keep entering these different rooms. In each room we had to find the thing that would let us through into the next place. When I say through I mean we would put these two things together with our arms stretched above us and it would pull us through this place in the wall. Some of them were decorated with Christmas stuff. I always had a more difficult time getting through those. I finally said to someone, about the third time, it was a Christmas thing, and I had trouble getting through. It was almost as though I was trying to break through a clear, rubbery substance. It looked like a regular Christmas display but when I tried to go through it would be very rubbery and difficult to break through. After the third time I said, All three times it was Christmas that I had difficulty getting through. I guess that tells me I still haven't worked through my Christmas issues. I've had a dream like this before, where I was going through these different rooms and breaking through these different scenes in a similar fashion. It seemed that to start this whole journey, or travel, or whatever, we had to take a bunch of pills that were various colors, sizes, and shapes. We were in this drug store or something and I worked there but then someone else that I worked for at another place came in and I couldn't let him see that I worked there. It would have made him mad. So I ducked behind the pharmacy counter and was trying to hide. But the owner that I worked for here was a pharmacist and was working back there. I finally had to say, I'll explain in a minute. As I was ducking down. I ducked down kind of in front of her and was trying to hide because this other person, I think it was a man came looking behind the counter. As he did so the pharmacist opened her pharmacy jacket enough to hide me further from his view so he didn't see me. After he left I said, I'm sorry. I work there too but he can't know that I also work here because it would make him mad. So she handed me a prescription and said, well, here. Just take care of this. I didn't want her to know that I was getting ready to leave to do this other thing - whatever it was. So I took the prescription and walked away.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-18),-0.134161,-0.011855918,0.13382594,-0.10564644
592,"I was at my birth home. I was standing at the kitchen window looking out. A car pulled up and turned into the driveway across the road. It used to be the driveway to Alig's house but their house was no longer there. The driveway was now flat and led back into the woods. There was a sign at the entrance of the driveway that faced the road and said Old Country Store. There was a log fence along the drive. I told Mother that I didn't realize that Alig's house was no longer there and that someone had put in that store. I was now in a car with Bill C and someone else. They wanted to see this country store so we were driving back the long driveway. I had the impression that they were expecting something like a Country General Store. I told them to keep in mind that we were in St. Joe and they shouldn't expect the typical in St. Joe. They dismissed me saying something to the effect that I shouldn't be critical. We got back to the store and walked in. There were two rooms to the store, a front room and a back room. There was a woman, perhaps my age or younger, or owned and operated the store. The front room was nothing but candles. We entered the back room and it was nothing but more candles. We came back from the front room and Bill C and the other person with us was somewhat incredulous that it was a candle store. I wanted to tell them that I warned them but I didn't. I was standing looking out a window of the store. There was a woman with long black hair lying on her back in the gravel playing with her dog. I mentioned this to Bill C. As we walked out of the store she moved over into the grass. I thought I recognized her. As we were pulling away in the car I realized it was Georgia D from high school.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-19),-0.28718725,-0.10022706,0.23053236,0.109341726
596,"I was in this town but I don't know what for. I was trying to drive home. I wasn't sure how to get back. It was kind of like a city. As I was driving through the city streets it was mid to late afternoon. The children were just getting out of school and they were all walking in the lanes of the streets. This was accepted practice. The cars had to just follow slowly behind them. There was one group of children that had a teacher walking with them. On one street there was one child walking alone and I had to just drive slowly behind her. I finally turned into this one place. I was going to stop and ask for directions. As I turned it took me down a spiral, like the spiral ramp at the airport. It spiraled down, and down, and down. I finally got to the bottom. I got out of my car. There wasn't a parking lot. I don't know what happened to the car. I realized that I was at a mall. I saw these two figures. It looked like projections of people, but the outlines of the body were primarily surrounded by something that looked like Christmas lights but the figures were talking to people who were there visiting the mall. I just stood there for a minute. I wasn't sure where to go or what to do. I turned for a minute, I was going to talk to them and then I decided against it, that I didn't want to. I turned away and then one of the figures addressed me. So I finally said, I'm lost. I came in looking for directions to try to help me find my way back home. This one figure moved towards me and as she did she became a regular person. She said she would walk with me and show me how to get home. So, we walked to a couple of different areas and we finally walked to this elevator bay. Somebody came by and had what looked like a red sale tag, about 3 x 6 inches, with white lettering. It said something about CAS and BCB. She brought it along and she was rubbing it against something along the walls of the elevator bay. I said to this woman who was going to show me the way, She has our price tag. The woman I was with said, Oh, you know them? I said, That's the company I work for. She said, Really? Then the elevator opened and she stepped in and it started to close very quickly, before I could get in. So she grabbed the door and opened it and I stepped in but it was only wide enough for you to stand with your back against the wall and the door closed and maybe 3-4 people could have gotten in and stood that way inside the elevator. Anyway, as the elevator closed she said, So you work for Bill C? That tall handsome man? I chuckled and said, Yes. She said, do you spend much time with him? I said, well, yes. She said something about him doing training and I said yes he does alot of training and there was something about him using the whiteboard. I said, He loves to use the whiteboard. He uses it constantly. She said, Oh. So you stand there and watch him use the whiteboard. I thought this was very odd but said yes. She said, He's facing the whiteboard so you have a rear view of him all the time. I suddenly realized what she was getting at. She said, does he really have such a good body? Again I chuckled and just said something like, it's a nice view. I thought it was all kind of silly. The elevator finally started and it was very fast and it just seemed to go down, and down, and down. We finally got out of the elevator and got into another one and we did the same thing. We did this several times. As we were doing this I was starting to wonder if I was in a parallel universe. I don't know why I thought this. The elevators, the whole environment, was very odd looking. When I was in the mall it was like this huge open space and everything was white. I didn't actually see any stores. When we went to the elevator bays, they were like this huge white open space, with big white round pillars. The doors of the elevators reminded me of gold glitter. Instead of just flat doors, I wish I knew how to explain this, kind of like different levels to the door . I don't know how to explain it. We finally got off the elevator and there were two men there. She asked one of them to take me the rest of the way. So she left me with him. I don't know if we got back on the elevators or not. We finally left this building and walked back outside. At one place it looked maybe like there was snow on the ground but it wasn't cold or wet or anything. This one place there were different animals running around. One was maybe a bull. We stayed out of the way but we weren't afraid of him or anything. It's as though I am observing this man with another woman. They were almost buried under this white stuff. I'm having trouble describing what this is. I think he became infatuated with this woman. It seemed that he was someone who could easily cross over between the two worlds, the two universes or whatever it was. And she wasn't. And he was bringing her into this universe, I guess, where I live in waking life. One or two times he picked her up and carried her. Somebody else said something to him about how to treat her if he really wanted to get her to fall for him.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-29),-0.06279334,-0.16461869,0.29173395,0.25283608
598,"I was at Larry K and Sue K's house. There were some other members of the family there. Larry came in. I asked him how I was doing. He said something like okay or something that I could tell that something wasn't quite right. So I questioned him further. He said that he had just gotten back from he said something about his first wife had taken him. He was going to have to pay his first wife $750,000 and then there was something else but I don't know what. He was obviously pretty distraught by this. I was talking to him about the power of the mind to create a reality. Then we also started rearranging the furniture in his bedroom so it would be more Feng Shui. His bedroom looked more like a hotel room. There was a door leading outside. One of the things we did was turn the bed around so that the foot of the bed was closest to the door leading outside but we also sitting kind of in the middle of the room. I think there was also a baby grand piano in this room. I was trying to remember where the appropriate place was for that, according to good Feng Shui. Then I remembered that I had something at home that I felt would be perfect in this room. So I was going to go get it. I went outside and I had this all wood, kind of like a wood chair. It was straight back. Wood seat. Nothing special to it. This was going to be my transportation. I thought I could get home pretty quickly this way. I'll just decide to go really fast instead of just sitting in the chair the regular way I straddled the back and kind of tipped back on the back two legs and started going. It was just as though I willed it to start moving and it did as though it had a motor and wheels. I went up into the air, thinking that would be quicker because I wouldn't have to follow the roads that way. I was flying through some trees that I normally would have been ducking and trying to get around the branches, but I just went straight through with no problem. Then I wanted to turn to the right and get back on the road at one point but I couldn't do it as fast as I was going so I decided to go to the left and see if I could do it that way and get on the road straight without slowing down. Then the next thing I know I'm on something  that acted like a ferry to take us across water except that it didn't look like that at all. It wasn't nearly that big and there was just something that was just flat and floating on the water that was taking across the water toward the other side or the next road. There were other people on it. There was a man with two young boys and they had a bunch of what looked like camping gear. I was talking to them a little bit and when we got to the other side of this water I was helping them unload. It's as though I totally forgot about Larry at this point. I was helping them to unload and set up and it turns out that it seems that maybe that man's wife, the little boy's mother, had died. They had owned a business there and they had decided, I guess the man decided it was time to go back and try to get the business going again.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-06-23),-0.18751837,-0.060933936,0.023790132,-0.13028069
602,"There was some kind of a gathering at my house. All my CRHP sisters were there and some dream clients. Rosie F from grade school was there. At least Mark M was there. I said do you really think you can help me with that? As we were standing there Mark was about to have an OBE. I was tugging on his arm saying, No Mark. Don't go. Don't go. The first time he kind of struggled and it was as though he was talking to someone about the experience he was having, telling them that I wouldn't let him go. That I didn't let him go. So he stayed but then the next time he was really fighting me mentally, willfully fighting me. I was pulling on his arm, by his elbow, saying, No Mark. Don't Go! Don't Go! But he went anyway. His body went limp. Myself and someone else sat his body on a sofa and I didn't know what to do. I was so scared and his eyes seemed to be open and he just stayed OB for a long time. After a while had passed I asked if everyone knew what to do or how to bring him back because he wasn't coming back. So finally someone else agreed with me that it might be a good idea to call Father Jerry. I guess he happened to be there because he walked in. He said, Yes. We need to pray. We called everyone into the room and asked them to form a circle, hold hands, and to pray for Mark - that he return to his body. Father Jerry didn't want to hold Mark's hand. Mark was to Father Jerry's right. I was going to go over and hold hand's with Father Jerry and hold Mark's hand. When I went over I ended up standing to Mark's right. I don't remember how that happened. Maybe someone else stepped in between Father Jerry and Mark. We said a prayer but it didn't help. The prayer didn't help. Mark was still OBE. More and more time passed and I was becoming very concerned and frightened. People were starting to leave. I didn't want them to leave and be alone in the house with him and not know what to do. Josie F. was there with someone else I knew - maybe a CRHP sister. I told her I was surprised and delighted to see her. She and the other person had their backs to the coffee table. The coffee table had a bunch of papers on it. It seems they were some kind of invitations I had sent out - to this event and to another event as well. Aunt P was also there. She was getting ready to leave but wanted to take her invitation with her. There were three identical ones lying there but she wanted to make sure she got her own. It seems there were two pieces of paper to each invitation. One was a floral paper in rose tones. The other was a kind of white frosted parchment type paper, like we use at CAS for licensing. She finally picked up the bottom of the three invitations and prepared to leave. We were at my home but it was different than my waking life home. She was going to leave through the back - maybe the kitchen. There were two doors at the corner in the right left of the room. One on each wall. She started to open the door on the back wall and I said, No. It's this door, meaning the one on the left wall. I opened it for her and she left. I am preparing to go outside but I know or see that there are two very large dogs out there so I am afraid to go out. They are blonde colored dogs with different shades of color on various parts of their bodies. I have decided to go try to find Mark's wife and tell her the bad news. I think I have decided that he is not coming back into his body - either willfully or because he can't. I have to somehow go past these dogs to be able to get to her. I finally decide to go ahead and go through - they are in a garage or some such area. Luckily they are sleeping and I manage to slip by them without waking them up. I think I may have woken one of them but it didn't catch me before I got to the other door. The other door seemed to lead into another home. Mark's wife was there and wanted to know who I was and what I was doing there. I introduced myself. I don't remember telling her why I was there but the next thing I knew we decided that if we go back to where Mark's body is sitting and we talk to him about their coming baby that he would somehow hear us and come back into his body. His wife raised her blouse and was rubbing her nipples. I think her and I were kind of singing something about their baby while she was doing this to get him to come back. It seemed that there were blue and purple colors on her nipples and the colors seemed to change as she rubbed them. We slowly saw Mark coming back into his body.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-07),-0.087979764,-0.29052514,-0.34117004,0.16800562
604,"It started out that I went to the YMCA. When I went back to the locker room all the different stalls were changing clothes. I was having trouble finding an empty one. There were three women in there that were getting married that day. They were using the Y to get dressed. One in particular had this big poofy dress that was lying on the floor so it was in this big circle. Right in the center there was a little open space where she would step into it. There wasn't much room to stand so I stood in that space waiting for a place to change. There were a bunch of women standing around waiting. Then someone handed us these little paper things that we could help these brides with while we were standing there waiting. They were little things that were maybe 1.5 x 5 inches. When I write it out it almost looks like the shape of my small cutting board, but it had an adhesive backing and we were pulling these off. One woman put the handle-like part in her mouth and blew on it as though we were supposed to blow them up. But we were standing there tearing the backs off for them. I would peel them off and stick one on each finger and then I would reach over to hand them to someone else. Then she would take them all and just put them in piles on top of each other. I wondered how they were going to be able to get them apart. The woman who was doing it didn't seem to think it was going to be a problem. I stepped out to the outside of this dress. I was going to step back in and I said, let me find my foot hole here. I stepped back in. Someone with one of the brides came out and got the dress and was helping her put it on and actually someone I think was helping the other brides as well. They got dressed. Now they were going to start the ceremony. It turns out that all three of them were getting married in the same ceremony, though none of them knew each other. I was standing at the front of this I was no longer in the locker room. I saw Cole P. I said, Hi Cole P. He put one hand on his stomach, leaned over a little bit and laughed and he said, I'm still Bernie Stout. I thought to myself, What is that about? Was his name really not Cole P? Why would he change his name or go by another name? Then I was afraid to say anything else to him because I didn't know that he had another name and I didn't know if I should say anything about it or just ignore it or what I should do. So then we're standing in this big room, but behind a curtain partition. We could see on the other side of this curtain that people were taking their seats for the wedding. There were some bridesmaids standing at the front. They had on black jackets that had gold lame threads running through the fabric. These bridesmaids had on dresses with a maroon color to it. Sitting in the front row is a woman who is dressed like the bridesmaids but her other color was gold or silver. She was sitting with some other people. I thought that was pretty unusual that one of them would be sitting there with the rest of the people while the rest of the bridesmaids were up front. Then I found out that these weddings were kind of a new way to get married and they had kind of a comical twist to it. It seems that the first bride just walked in. The next one, someone was helping her in. The third one I think maybe someone was carrying her. Maybe the second one was being carried and the third one walked. I don't remember now. Then I realized that this is a business of Cole P's. That he sells these wedding packages to people and it's always two weddings at a time. I have these forms where we were selling CAS books and products. I had gone to this place to drop off these forms so people there could order our books and stuff. There were alot of supplier people there. Apparently they host a breakfast or something for suppliers. They didn't have any breakfast. A number of different people were there. When you came in you had to take off your shoes. There was a place outside to put your shoes. There was a large square platform. Different parts of the platform had things written on it. One part said, Business Professional People or something like that. So one woman came and said, Why don't you put my shoes and put them in the professional section? So I took my shoes off, I realized I hadn't taken them off yet. I went out and put mine there as well, though there were already several pair of shoes there so I was trying not to set mine on top of someone else's. I was trying to find a clear space where I could set mine and I did. After these three weddings were over, somehow it was very odd. Then I was going to take these forms back to Cole P. There was someone that I think worked for him in the car with me. His business was in BR. I went there. I almost have the feeling that I went there and I parked and then I left and then went again, this time was when that employee was with me. I was going to park the same place and she pointed out that wherever I was. When I was getting ready to leave from wherever I was the first time to take these to Cole P's place of business, this woman was with me. We started backing up and I told her where I was going and she said, Oh. You mean the office right next to where you were. I said I didn't even realize that's where it was. So I was just going to pull back into the same parking space. She said, No. It would be better if you parked over here. She directed me to 3/4 way around the block to park. I thought it was quite a little ways to walk. I didn't mind the walk but I wondered why I had to drive so far away when I could have just parked in the same spot, and right next to the door. I just went ahead and did it. I took the forms in and there were these bags that had forms in them. They were on shelves, kind of high up so I was kind of standing on my tiptoes trying to see the right place to put my forms. Cole P came out and we were chatting for a little bit and another person comes in or sticks his head in the door. He says something about the business. Cole P says, Well. We've gone to three now. Meaning that instead of just two weddings at a time they do three. So we're talking and he said, Great! Sign me up. I was surprised at how popular this was. Apparently Cole P was just almost booked solid with this service he was selling. As part of the package he provided all of the wedding details too. But still I was surprised and so as we continued to chat he said something to somebody about the double edge, referring to two weddings at once. Then after he told this other man that he went to three, and that man left, I said, So now it's the triple edge. There was also something about us deciding to offer some kind of wedding gift. It seemed more as though our gift was going to be something to do rather than a typical wedding gift. I was spending I was also going to have to redo the forms to include something about this wedding gift that they were going to receive.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-12),-0.2472438,-0.0034050322,0.29482734,-0.2257187
606,"I was on a business trip with Bill C. We were in a hotel room. Actually I was there and Bill C came in. The room had two double beds. I was going to sleep in one and he was going to sleep in the other. It was in my head that this was just the way we always did it. We were talking about related to business as he was getting ready for bed. After he was ready for bed he came to my bed and started to climb in. I was lying where he was trying to get in. He said, What do you mean what am I doing? You know what I'm doing. I didn't. I went ahead and moved over and he got into bed with me. He kissed me. I was thinking that he wasn't a bad kisser and then I thought he could move a little more but still not bad. At some point Bill C became Daniel R. Now I was on a bus and Daniel R got on the bus and at first, even though there was an empty seat next to me, he took a seat a couple rows back. This was a very short bus. Not a typical bus. Maybe only 5 or 6 rows of seats. There were 3 seats on one side of the aisle and maybe 2-3 on the other side of the aisle. I got up and went back and sat next to him. I put my hand through his arm, at his elbow. We were talking and he was kind of upset about something, not upset at me. He got up and moved into another seat then. I thought I would just let him go. This bus had alot of black people on it. In fact, I think Daniel R and I were the only white people on the bus. I turned around a couple of times. I finally asked one of them if the white man was asleep. They said yes. We pulled up. I guess he woke up and got up and came and sat next to me again. We pulled up to this place where we were getting off. We got off and we were walking together and again I had my hand in his elbow, holding on at his elbow. It continues to be something about finding the document or something on the computer. I don't know what computer we're using since we are on the road traveling. Something continues about or related to him kissing me and related to the fact that my shoulder was bothering me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-13),-0.07342487,-0.19483592,-0.281958,0.012820127
607,"I was traveling with my brother and one sister [not my brother and sister in waking life] . We stopped and checked into a hotel. I think we checked into two or three separate rooms. We were going there to visit another sister who was having some kind of a party. We checked into our hotel rooms and then we went to see this other sister. It was apparently going to be kind of a wild party and they were smoking marijuana. I hung around for a little bit and then I went outside. I was really struggling with the fact that they were smoking marijuana. I finally decided that I had to be true to myself and I just couldn't stay since they were doing that. I went and told her and she got upset and she thought I was being a snob. I said, You know, it's up to you what you do. But I have to be true to myself and I can't stay here when things like that are going on. I just can't. I just can't be a part of that. My one sister, it seems that it was Betty B, was disappointed because she really wanted to party. She just decided to stay. I went and told my brother that I was leaving and he said, Good. He also didn't want to stay for the same reason. We went to our hotel rooms and got our stuff together. We went to the front desk and there were alot of people needing assistance at the front desk for various things - mostly checking in. There were two or three different service window areas. They had accordion fold shutters across these windows. They had only one of the windows open and there was no one there. So I walked around and looked in a door that was partially open. I saw a grey-haired gentleman sitting at a desk working. I asked if we could get some help out here at the window. I went back down and other people were starting to line up at the window then. I pushed ahead since I was there first and since I was the one to actually go get help. I thought I deserved to be first in line. Someone else tried to push ahead of me. Then a man and a woman came up to start helping people and the others in line stepped back and told them to take care of me first since I was there first. I handed her my room key and told her that we were checking out. She took my key and walked away. When she came back she was holding up this long piece of paper. She said, You're going to have a good reason since it is before 6 p.m. I told her that the transmission on my car died or something, I wasn't sure what was wrong with it that I just knew it had major problems and I had to go get it fixed. She went ahead and checked me out. I told her that my brother is in another room and he is leaving with me for the same reason, so you know when he comes to check out. There were two men sitting at a table in the lobby. The table was a rectangle shape. One was sitting on a side and the other was sitting on an end. I think that maybe they had a child or two with them. One gentleman was tall and thin and had dark hair. He had kind of a country look, wearing blue jeans and a hat. He said something but I don't know if he was talking to the children or to me. I don't even remember what he said. I went to the room to finish getting my things together. My brother, David [not in waking life] , came in and we were getting the stuff together. We had unmade the bed. We were debating whether we should just make the bed up again. A woman came in and said, This is a mess. We're going to have to charge you something. I said, but we've only been here a little while. How about if we make the bed? David and I started making the bed. He was kind of playing around, making it more difficult. I told him to just slow down and take it easy so we could get it put back together. As we were making the bed there were a bunch of pillows. Not all of them were regular bed pillows. I had taken my body pillow with me so I took that off and put it on the floor. There was a royal blue backpack. It was there with the pillows but it looked like a backpack. There was also a pillow that had a pink seersucker fabric, kind of like my table topper in waking life. I realized that it was our pillow but I decided to just leave it for them because we needed enough pillows to make it look like it did when we checked in. So I used the royal blue backpack as a pillow as well. We made the bed and I asked if that was okay. I was picking up some trash. We had some trash in one of the wastebaskets, so I made sure that all the trash was just in the one wastebasket. We had used two glasses and I went ahead and just left them sitting there. There was something there that looked kind of like a small pitcher but it didn't have a handle on it. It had water in it. I left that sit there. Now there is a little girl with us. She walks up and says something to this woman. I don't remember all of what she said but part of what she said was, I hope you don't hate us. The woman softened and thought, How can I be mad at them with this little girl and her saying that? We went ahead then and I asked David if he was okay to drive, if he would mind driving. He said, No. Not at all. So we left.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-15),-0.26552954,-0.1712528,0.13669743,-0.20032804
608,"I was in a car by myself. I couldn't get the brakes to work and the gas pedal seemed to be stuck, maybe the brake pedal as well. I was beginning to get scared because I didn't know how to stop it or slow it down. It seemed to actually pick up speed; it was going pretty fast. I pulled off into this field. I was going to drive around in circles in this field until I figured out what to do. I saw a police officer sitting in a patrol car in the field watching traffic. I thought, He's going to come after me but I don't know what else to do. I went ahead and pulled into the field. Sure enough, the officer turned on his flashing lights and came after me. He pulled up along side of me and looked at me. I said, help me. I can't stop my car. I thought he was going to abandon his car and try to jump onto and into mine so he could help me. Shortly after that I was able to stop the car or it stopped itself. I looked down and saw that the floor mat had been jammed up under the pedals. It had the gas pedal stuck so the car was going fast but it also had the brake pedal stuck so I couldn't press down on it to stop the car. I just fixed the floor mat, started the car back up and then left. The policeman was mad, not because I had left but because he had come so far into the field. I don't know if he got stuck. I don't know. But he was kind of upset.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-15),-0.104720645,-0.22302213,-0.0022436976,0.37736428
609,"I went on retreat and I was driving a van. I was at the retreat. I think I was with someone else. I had spent the night the night before the retreat. That morning I got up and got ready and took my suitcase with me to the retreat room. It was in another building. The building where we slept was on one side of the parking lot and the building where they held the retreat was on the other so we had to cross the parking lot to get to the area where the retreat was being held. I took my suitcase with me. I put it and my purse in front of the room. At the end of the day, after the retreat was over, I walked out and realized that I didn't have my keys or my purse so I ran back in and grabbed my purse. There were now two purses. I picked them back up and started walking back out. I had said something as I ran back in because I was afraid they were going to lock the door on me. I ran back in and said, I realized that I had forgotten my purse. When I started walking out with two of them they said something to me. I said, I know that's the problem with these small purses. I tried to change them but I was running out of time when I had them half switched and had to leave so I ended up bringing both of them. It's just ridiculous. So I walked out and was putting things in the van. In this white van there were small compartments on the right side. One was just a bit bigger than an average size flashlight. The other was a bit bigger than that, maybe two feet x two feet square. One door on it had to shut before the other. None of them were more than a few inches deep. I don't remember them having handles on them so I don't know how I got them open. I opened the larger one and realized that my suitcase wasn't going to fit in there and that I would have to put it inside the van. I went back to my room. I was going to change my clothes before I headed back. I realized I didn't have my suitcase. I left it in the other building. I had half-changed clothes. I grabbed my keys because I was going to drive across the parking lot because I thought it would be faster, even though it was only a few hundred feet. I was afraid the building would be locked. I was in the lobby of the building where we slept and I heard someone coming down the steps. The steps had dark wood banisters with round carved spindles. It seemed more flat than it did like a staircase. I only saw the flat part that was about one story above me. I didn't actually see the part where he would come down. I waited. I was going to ask them before I went over if they knew what time they lock the doors. It was a man that was at the retreat. He had his luggage with him. I asked him if he knew what time the other building got locked. He said, No. I'm on retreat here like everyone else. He was very rude. I said, Well, I just thought if you had been here on retreat before that you might know. Another man who was on retreat had overheard this. He said, don't let him bother you. I was clearly embarrassed and felt bad. I just said to the other man, I'm very sorry that I bothered you. Then I went outside. It was starting to rain. My van was now a baby bed. One of the wheels was missing. I realized that the wheel was still inside so it would be faster for me to just go over there.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-16),-0.19941685,-0.21755303,0.18950506,0.061762307
612,"I was working at the CAS office and we hired a secretarial person. She was an older woman. Our office was in a house. It reminded me of my birth home. Her office was in the living room. I didn't spend a lot of time training her that day. I was very busy. That wasn't a good excuse but I just didn't spend a lot of time training her that day. That evening after everyone else left, I called Jeff K to ask him about something. He said it sounded as though we need to meet. I said, Okay. When? He said, Well. If you have the time now I'll just come over now. He came over and we started talking and working. I said something about advertising. I guess he realized that we weren't doing what he thought we were doing and he said, well, this is just useless. So he started packing up his stuff and getting ready to leave. I said, Now wait. Wait. Let's take care of this. He said, Oh. It's just useless. He said, well, we'll have to do something else. Let me go back and work on this. I walked him to the door through the kitchen and out the back door to the breezeway. He put on his jacket and I saw him lean over and move something that looked like a white tarp, as though he were uncovering something. He picked up a bike. I think he was embarrassed or something to have me see that he came over there on a bike. He said, excuse me. He pulled the bike across the front of me, running over my toe. I didn't say anything. I said, How close to here do you live? He said, I don't know that I told you that I moved not very long ago. I said, Yes. But how close do you live? He never did answer me. I was watching him. He was doing something to the bike, like adjusting the seat or maybe it was one of those bikes with hinges that you can fold up and he was unfolding it. I was thinking that this was a very nice and very expensive bike. It was dark outside already. I was concerned that he was going to be riding his bike in the dark. I didn't people in cars would see him. He just got on his bike and started riding away. I said, Jeff K. That's dangerous. They can't see you. You don't have anything reflective on. He just kept riding. I watched him ride down the driveway and turn right onto the rode. His jacket glowed in the dark a little so I could see him a little bit. After he got down the rode just a little ways he turned around and came back. I said, well, it's better than I thought. But it's still dangerous. He stopped further down on the sidewalk. He asked me something about how satisfied we are with his work. I couldn't understand because he was too far away. I said, Jeff K, come up here closer. I can't hear you. He said, No, Anna. Just answer the question. I said, Jeff K, I have a severe hearing loss. I really can't hear you. I heard him say something like, she can hear me . He turned around and rode off again. I got mad. I went inside and kind of slammed the door behind me. As I went in I realized that all of the cabinet doors were now standing open. At first I just started closing them. Then I realized that they weren't open when Jeff K and I left. I got really scared because I realized this meant that someone was in there. I just turned around and darted back out to the breezeway. I was just going to get out of there. As I got out to the breezeway Jeff K had come back again. I was so glad. I said, Jeff K. Someone is in there. I know someone is in there because all the cabinet doors were open when I went back in and they weren't when you and I came out earlier. I think he was going to go in. I didn't want him to because I was afraid for him. I didn't want him to get hurt either. I didn't know who was in there or what they were doing or what they might do to us.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-19),-0.30336922,-0.07573672,-0.33735186,-0.058189746
614,"I went to see Tony S and Dorothy S. Their house was in a fairly isolated area. I didn't see any other houses around. There wasn't a lot of grass either. I pulled up next to a very small dry creek bed. There were a couple of other cars there. On the other side of my car there was a wood slat fence. I can't think what you call it now, where the wood planks run horizontal and there are three or four per section of fence. I went inside the house. We were talking a little bit. We were lying down, watching TV and talking. I think twice I said how good it is to see her again. I told myself that I was glad that I paid attention to the messages telling me that I needed to go see her again. That I needed to mend fences, so to speak. As we were lying there I think she asked me about where I'm working now. I told her about the story behind my new business name. One of the drafts of my brochures were laying there so I got up and picked one up and handed it to her. She said something that irritated me and made me think that this is why I hadn't been back to see her in so long. I don't remember now what she said. I think we were supposed to go have lunch together. I was thinking that we should get up and go have lunch. We did get up. I thought we were getting ready to go and then her mother came in. She said to me, well, we need to get back to work now. It was very good seeing you. I thought, What's going on? Miscommunication or something? Her young boys were there, in waking life she has girls. So her and her mom went ahead and left and I was still there with the boys. There was a large plastic container sitting there on a stool. It was full of snacks. I was thinking that she has it there so it is easy for the children to get snacks when they want them and her or Tony S aren't there. I was thinking about the fact that it is always sitting there on that stool. It has been for as many years as I can remember. I was thinking about the fact that that is very comfortable for her and Tony S but I could never do that. I would always want it put away someplace. I opened the container and there were some diet potato chips that were already open. I opened the bag and took a few out and then put the bag back in. I saw Dorothy S was headed back in towards the house so I hurried and put the bag back. I didn't want her to see that I had taken some chips, even though I think she had invited me to have something. I don't know why I didn't want her to know that I did take some chips. I was also holding some books, notepad, or something. I had the chips lying on there and was trying to hide them. I was now outside, headed to my car to go home. When I went outside I was disoriented as far as where I had parked my car. It wasn't where I thought I had parked it. I was trying to figure out where my car was. I saw a creek bed and I knew that I had parked by a creek bed. So I went over there and started walking along it. It went into a very hilly, rocky area. I knew I didn't walk through anything like that when I parked and went in to the house. As I was standing there some people came through the rocky, hilly area. They were just out hiking. I turned around and headed back in the direction that I came from. Dorothy S was there again saying something about I guess she was trying to help me figure out where I was parked.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-19),-0.30232248,-0.16667052,0.19443889,-0.0998817
621,"I was driving up to my home and saw one of the maintenance men in a pickup truck close to my house. I did a hairpin U-turn and pulled up along side him, with each of us facing in opposite directions. However, in my dream my driver's side window was right next to his, which couldn't have been true in waking life the way we were positioned. I don't know who the man was; I hadn't seen him or this truck before. I asked him if they were going to be replacing my windows soon. I don't know what he said. I think John D may have walked up at the time. I had agreed to host a cookie baking day at my home for a bunch of my women friends to raise money for local children' charities. The idea actually originated with Alicia J in California. Unfortunately, the day we were to bake cookies the maintenance men decided to install new windows throughout my home. I didn't think it would be a problem because I had been noticing that it wasn't taking them too long to do the replacements in other homes in my community. I didn't have a chance to warn anyone so when my friends started showing up to bake cookies the house was void of most furniture because of the windows. I have no idea where we put it though. In a way this was good because we had lots of room to set up tables for cookies. Matthew had gotten some fold up tables from somewhere for us. The kitchen had two windows and I told them those were especially important to get done quickly so we wouldn't have to worry about dust and dirt in the cookies. Alicia J came to help and brought some one with her. As I was greeting Alicia J and talking to some of the others as they arrived Sue P and Barbara D arrived. They didn't say hello or anything but simply started setting up. They started laying tablecloths on the floor for cookies to cool. I told them we could set up the tables. I sent Matthew to bring the tables in and set them up. I pointed out what large tables they were. I continued talking to Alicia J and there was a man standing there as well who came to help. Alicia J asked him what organization his benefits were going to. He said the Children's Wizard of Oz fund in my city, which I don't think exists in waking life. I was afraid she would ask me and I hadn't arranged to make money off of this so I would have some to donate but I liked the idea of the Wizard of Oz fund. I debated whether or not I should just tell her that I was donating to that group if she asked. I could always make a donation to the group. Julie D came to help and brought her two daughters. I was talking to someone about the windows being replaced and jokingly said something about not knowing what I was going to do with all of my old furniture now. Apparently I was getting grid of some old furniture. Actually it was only my old desk. it was a blonde colored wood with a hutch. I am standing at a table and helping to get set up. I was spreading out bowls and such. I said I would help with mixing. That's what I prefer to do when we have our annual family cookie baking day. One bowl looked like it had a few chocolate chips in it. I then turned around to help get the rest of the room organized. I noticed that Julie D had brought in a children's table and chairs, which I thought was cute and a good idea. There was some food on it - like muffins. I realized that I hadn't had breakfast yet and saw someone had brought muffins for all of us to share that morning. I went and got a cranberry muffin, broke it in half and was eating it while I was walking around. I decided to check with the men and see how they were progressing with the windows, because they didn't seem to be making much progress at all. I went outside and noticed a small fire in the building. They were getting ready to put it out and didn't seem to be concerned at all. this was a very tall city building. The outside was very shiny gold and glass. I noticed a relatively small hole in one of the walls and a fire there as well. Again, they were getting ready to put it out and didn't seem concerned. I hoped my friends didn't find out about it because I thought they would become overly anxious or concerned.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-26),-0.03107367,-0.19107874,-0.018633027,0.079485685
625,"It seems as though I am myself and at another point it seems that I am Carly from some daytime soap opera. Early in the dream Carly had been kidnapped. Her boyfriend, Jack, who is a police officer, found her, but didn't tell anyone right away that he found her. They made love. I don't know why he didn't tell anyone that he found her. Later she, or I, am with a young college boy. Some other woman found out that she/I was kind of seeing this young college man. He was into computers. That's what he was studying. I'm in this room with this other woman. There are empty boxes under this cabinet. One of them is evidence that he is using AOL. The other is evidence of where I/Carly am. This other woman realized that Jack had found me but didn't tell anyone. She also knew that this man wasn't supposed to be using AOL at school so she wanted to expose both of us. I was trying to get her not to. I'm not sure why. I hid the box that would let people know that Jack had found me. I kind of stashed in towards the back of the cabinet behind something else. I did the same thing with the AOL. Now the college man is working on a project with some classmates. I see his laptop sitting. We're in a mall now but he is sitting with all of these six-foot long folding tables. His laptop is sitting on one of these tables at the front of the room right by the door. There is a big red button on the front that says AOL. It's maybe 1 by 2 inches long. It identifies that he uses AOL. I saw it and knew that it had something to do with this woman who wanted to expose him so I turned it off. I hesitated to interrupt him because he was working with his classmates but decided to anyway. I went up to his left side and bent down and tapped him. He leaned back in his chair and I whispered to him what I had just noticed. He wasn't all that concerned about it. I told him that this woman wanted to expose him but he just wasn't that concerned. Now I'm going through a large department store in the mall. I'm on the first floor and I'm walking through a children's clothing department. I go to the escalator. The two escalators, up and down, are divided by steps. It is a really steep staircase so I decided to take the escalators. Instead of steps on the escalator it is flat like a people mover but it goes up. I get on there and I stand to the left. I reached for the rail but there is a woman who is taking the steps at the same time and she grabs the escalator handrail. Since this is so steep I know I am going to need to hold on so I grab the right handrail. I was kind of irritated that this woman who was walking up the steps was in such good shape that she was keeping up with the escalator. I was upset because I didn't think I was in good enough shape to do that. I moved over to the right of the escalator so I could hold on to that handrail. The escalators were much wider than they are in waking life. Still, as it gets to the top I have to exert a lot of energy and strength to hold on and get to the top. I almost have to pull myself off. Then you walk a few feet and there is another incline and handrail and I have to hold on to that handrail as I walk up this other shorter yet steep incline. I have to pull myself along to get up that one. I finally got up there and I'm walking around. I think I'm in the women clothing department now. The college man shows up and is walking with me. We're walking through the various departments and he starts reading something to me that he found. It's a piece of literature or something that someone had written. It has lots of adjectives. It's very sensory. It talks about smells and sights and such. I thought it was very nicely written and I especially liked all the sensory details. He was kind of making fun of it. I asked him if he had ever really paid attention to the sensory experiences in his life, the smells, the sights, the sounds. He kind of laughed. I said I guess that's a difference in our age. I am 20 something years older than you. I started thinking about that or maybe I was talking to someone about it. Isn't it fairly common for very young men to fantasize about being with an older woman and maybe that's all this was for him. Maybe his desire to be with me was maybe just fulfilling some fantasy, wanting to experience lovemaking with an older woman, what an older woman might teach him about romance and intimacy.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-27),-0.15819846,-0.10427366,-0.094504386,-0.069887646
626,"I was with Matthew and some other people, though I don't remember who they were. I think we were at PLU. There was some kind of event going on to teach women safety, especially for walking on campus at night alone, even though they didn't recommend that. But if they had to they wanted them to know these techniques to stay safe. That evening I was walking across campus and it was starting to get dark. I was thinking about the techniques. I picked up a round thing and tossed it like a hoop and it landed around this one thing. Somehow that was part of the technique. I then picked it up and later did the same thing. Then I picked it up and went back into this place. It might have been a coed dorm but I'm not sure. There were a bunch of men sitting around, talking and carrying on. This one young girl was getting ready to go out. One of the men yelled at her, Hey. You better be safe out there. I just went off on him. I was so angry. I said, These women are scared enough as it is. They're being taught to do things to stay safe. Then you say something that is frightening. I mean I really went off on him. A couple of the other men that were there kind of supported me and told him he was out of line and that he owed this girl a big apology. He wasn't about to apologize. It seems that maybe there was something that had been happening on campus where some women had been getting hurt that prompted this whole thing. I went back and joined the rest of my group that I was there with. I picked up a hat. At this point I don't think I was myself. I think I was one of the girls living in this, I don't know if it was a dorm. I was living with three other women. I picked up this hat and asked two of the other girls, Do you think this is Jamie's? Jamie was our other roommate. They said they were sure that it was. That concerned me because for some reason I thought that meant that she was in danger of this man who was doing these things. There was an older woman there. Maybe one of the girls mother or aunt. She got a phone call from this man and she put him on speakerphone. The voice sounded kind of creepy. I was listening to things that he was saying and he was saying about something being inspiring. As he said that there were these green vines around some part overhead and they started intertwining as he was speaking and talking about whatever it was that he thought was inspiring. I went to my other two roommates and I said I think that was him. I said, Just by the sound of his voice and the things that he was saying. I'm just so sure that was him. We went to some kind of a snack bar to get something to eat and we moved up through the line. When it was my turn I stepped over to one young girl who was taking orders and she started to help me but then stopped and walked away. She never came back. An adult male who was standing next to her taking orders kept taking person after person after person after me. He said, Well, I need to stay at the register here. He said this to her so she wouldn't come back and try to work at the register also. So I asked him, Could you take me? Because you've taken like 10 people who came up here after me. He kind of shrugged his shoulders and took my order. I ordered a hot dog and a diet sprite. He gave me the hot dog and a can of diet sprite. I started to hand him my money and he took my wallet and asked me if I had some kind of ID or something because I would get a discount if I did. I said no. He mentioned another and another. I said no, no. Matthew said, Well. She does but not for one here at PLU. He said, Well then that won't work. I finally took my wallet back and handed him the amount of money that he needed for my order.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-28),-0.2568469,-0.23060194,0.07532462,0.00763045
628,"Bev was visiting. Andrew S was with her. There was also a little girl, about 3 years old. I was trying to get ready for work and was trying on outfit after outfit. I was trying to find something to go with peach-colored jeans that I was wearing. The shirts either didn't match or they were too small or too big. I finally decided on something. I was running very late. I asked Bev if Mari Kate S could come up and help me but I don't know if she wasn't there or if she was doing something else. Andrew S came up to help me. He was helping me to pull one of my shirts down in the back. I was leery about having him help but finally decided it was fine. Then he stood outside the door. I told him he had to wait out there because I was going to try on yet another one. When I got ready to leave there were about 5 or 6 steps outside the apartment front door. I kind of ran down but almost in a skipping way. I saw Andrew S follow. I took a right on the sidewalk - it was sloped downward. Then I took another right and it was sloped upward. I was headed to my car. Andrew S was following me and the little girl was following him. I said, Andrew S. You have to watch her. You need to go back inside. Your mom is going to wonder where you are. He kept following me and the little girl kept walking out into the street. I said, Andrew S. You have to watch her. You have to keep her out of the street. She can't play in the streets here. I said it very tersely the second time. He wasn't paying attention. She kept going out into the street. I was getting frustrated because I was late for work. I stopped and turned around and said, Andrew S. You have GOT to keep her out of the street. This time I sounded even more terse. He finally turned around and went and picked her up and headed back inside.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-19),-0.3114571,-0.23278219,0.010263728,0.1898997
629,"Matthew and I were staying at this place. It wasn't a hotel. It was more like a college dorm, but there were families living or staying there. I know at least some of them were single parent families. I don't even know how long we had been there. We had been there long enough that I was involved in a relationship with the actor Dabney Coleman. I was thinking how odd it was that I was in a relationship with him because I don't particularly care for him in waking life. There is something about him that just doesn't feel right to me. We were involved in this relationship. I don't know how serious it was. I don't know if we could even really call it a relationship. We were seeing each other on a regular basis. I was talking this other woman who was sitting there with her children. Her name was Raegen U. We were talking about relationships but I can't remember much about the conversation. For some reason I had gone to her room and the door was partially open. I started to go in and then stepped back because it didn't like anyone was there. I started to walk away and then I thought she was in there with someone. So I went back in just part of the way and realized that she was in there with Dabney. Again I started to walk away but stopped. I decided that I was not going to just let this go. They were being intimate. They were on the floor and had actually rolled partially under the bed. I went in and climbed up on the bed and said, Hey Dabney. How's it going? I had startled them so bad they almost jumped out and sat upright. I kind of saluted him and said, Good to see you. Then I walked out. I thought well that's the end of that and then realized that it made sense. I had this feeling that something like this was going on. I went back to Matthew and asked him if he wanted something for dinner. He said yes he was hungry. I asked him if pizza sounded okay. He said sure. I said, Let me go to the store and get something. He told me what kind he wanted. So I went to get it. I had originally planned to get it for all of us, for Raegen U and her kids and for Dabney and his kids. Obviously that changed my mind so I just got something for me and Matthew. I must have taken it back to Matthew to start fixing it. I had been doing some cleaning. I finished vacuuming our room. Oh. Raegen U and Dabney were in Dabney's room. I took the vacuum to Raegen U's room because I had intended to vacuum her room for her. I decided I wasn't going to do that now. Someone else came in. She was going to give me something for Raegen U's kids and she wanted to explain it to me. I said, Nope. No need. I won't be back. I didn't even look at the person. I just sat the vacuum down and walked out. I said to myself, I knew something was going on. Maybe it was later that I think in the dream I was just imagining having a conversation with either Raegen U or Dabney and them thinking that I was mad. I was imagining saying, No. I'm really not angry. I'm feeling a lot of things but angry isn't one of them. Relieved is one. I'm relieved that I found out when I did. I also feel stupid that this was going on without me knowing about it before now. I'm feeling a little frustrated with myself for not paying attention sooner when I suspected that something was going on. I'm glad that I finally found out.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-08-01),-0.24933973,-0.2186923,-0.23563212,-0.12167064
634,"Ben D had come to the city where I live to visit me. He had actually driven here. He had either been somewhere else or was headed somewhere else. When he came to see me, one of my spiritual direction clients was here so we didn't get to spend any private time together or any time alone. We were both very disappointed by this. He was also I'm having trouble following the thread of this. He had also had a suitcase and had used one of the bathrooms. Maybe he had taken a shower? Later he needed to leave and now the directee's husband was here as well. The husband was in the bathroom so she was going to go get the rest of Ben D's things out of the bathroom. She asked him, I guess, what he normally does with his things. He said he just wipes them off. I think maybe they had a small child also. Maybe she sent the child into the bathroom to his dad to get Ben D's things. The man came out with the things and Ben D had to go. I saw him in his car. It was an old, grey, rusty, faded, beat up car. For some reason I wasn't surprised by this. Maybe it's what I expected or maybe I was thinking that I had seen it when I was in SC. Then he and I are both on the road but in separate cars. I'm ahead of him. I keep looking in my rearview mirror and checking to see if he is behind me. There are one or two police cars. One of them turns on it's flashing lights. At first I'm concerned that they want to pull me over but then I realize that it's not me they are signaling. Then Ben D is in the far right lane and I am in the far left lane. There was bumper to bumper traffic. A couple of times I get very upset because I have to slam on my breaks and I'm worried that I'm going to hit someone or that Ben D or someone else is going to hit me from behind. But nothing happens. There is also another police car in the far left lane that pulls someone over. Ben D and I are both very disappointed that we didn't get to spend any time alone together. For some reason, while we are driving, I keep thinking that I am going to pull off to my right and that Ben D will pull off behind me.

642,"I was at Bev's house visiting. We were outside walking. There was a little sports car sitting there. I can't think of what it's called. A MG maybe? It was old and the color was grey. I realized when I saw it that they were holding it for me, that it was mine. It ran. You could drive it. But it needed some work to be able to drive it consistently or for very long. I had spent $10,000 on this car. I asked John S if it was saleable as it was, if he thought I could at least get my money back out of it. He thought I could. At that point I didn't want to ask him to try to sell it for me. It was a stick shift and I don't know how to drive a stick shift. I was wondering if I could learn enough to drive it to Daddy's house and ask him to try to sell it for me. I didn't really want to ask him to do it for me either, yet I knew I didn't really know enough about it to be able to sell it and not have someone take advantage of me. While I was at Bev's house I was really wrestling with this in my head, trying to figure out what to do because I wanted it out of there plus I wanted to sell it and have the money instead. In the meantime we were walking around their house, now I think I was walking with someone besides Bev. I was telling this person that I would really like to have a house similar to Bev's where we had a family room and formal living room and an eat-in kitchen as well as a dining room. Where I had a bedroom for each of my children who were still living at home plus one or two guest bedrooms. I saw John kick something with the toe of his shoe and he seemed to be hinting around at something. I told him he could just tell me that I would like him to tell me the truth. I said I would like him to tell me the truth gently but I would like to hear the truth. He told me that there was some stuff in a large plastic container that belonged to me and they had agreed to store it for me. I was digging through it. I think it had a bunch of black stones in it. I dug beneath the stones and found some decorative glass bottles and there were some small plastic containers in there. The large plastic container was hers. I apologized for forgetting that she had those for me. I pulled them all out and was going to take them with me. I could tell Bev and John were both very happy that I was going to take the stuff home. At one point, earlier, it had come out while I wasn't around that John was very frustrated with storing it though he was trying to be nice and not let me know that he was frustrated. So I decided that I would take the glass bottles home and clean them up and keep. There were also some small plastic things that I was thinking about selling at a garage sale or just get rid of. There were also some T-shirts that they had been storing in another place. I think they had things like Coca-Cola logos or pictures or something on them. I decided I was just going to give those to Kim H so I folded them up and gave them to Matthew to give to Kim H for me. I wasn't sure if the large plastic container was mine. There was also a very large blue plastic tray that had many dividers in it. I asked Bev if those belonged to her. She said yes as she took them from me and started to go put them away. I said, Oh. Shoot. She looked around and didn't look very happy, and asked What? I said, Oh no. Nothing. Nothing. She just turned around and went and put them away. I had said that just because the blue tray with dividers would have been very convenient to have for storing little things and keeping them separated. I don't know what I would have put in there or where I would have stored such a thing in my own home. I continued to wrestle with what to do about the car.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-08-17),-0.2311602,-0.035436373,-0.080449305,0.1630364
643,"I was one of five young college students. Two female and three male. We were working on a scientific experiment. We had taken some pieces of food, maybe broccoli, and we had applied something to them. This caused them to grow at a tremendous rate and grow into something else. There were three of them. They had grown to 4 or 5 feet tall over just a few days and had developed these beautiful flowers. One was kind of a teal color, just exquisite. The other was a purple color. Two of the men had extracted something from these plants and had been working with that substance. They were close to developing a substance that would form or become human bone. They had taken an eyedropper and squeezed some of this substance into a form. This would be an incredible medical breakthrough to be able to replace bones of people with related injuries. One of the men took the eyedropper and was squeezing the substance out onto his the bridge of his nose and down the sides of his noise. I kept telling him not to do that because we don't know enough about it yet. I told him he didn't know what he was doing. I was saying this with a sense of panic or urgency. Fortunately it ended up not harming him in anyway but it really frightened me for him to do that. We weren't ready to tell anyone about it yet, about the plants, the way they grew, or the bone development. We were spending a lot of our own money working on this so we were all going broke. We were trying to still make ends meet while proceeding with the experiment and not telling anyone. Twice we were leaving campus by car and we saw a vehicle enter campus that we knew was a bill collector looking for us. So we would take shortcuts through the grass and such to get out as quickly as possible and without them seeing us. The second time one of the men had a black hardside briefcase. He said he had his life savings or something in there. One of the other men said we were about to get lucky. The man with all the money said yes, he would say so. The other man asked how lucky? The first one said, Pretty lucky. I had developed a problem with my throat so went to a medical facility to get tested. A woman working there had me lean over this piece of equipment. Initially I was supposed to try to sneeze a couple of times, which I kind of fake sneezed. Then I was supposed to start coughing onto this thing and keep doing so. As I did this it became easier and easier and I could tell that it was helping. She smiled and nodded. She told me to stop while she pulled a little blue plastic piece out of the machine and put a new one in. Then she told me to start coughing again. After just two or three coughs the blue piece flipped up into a vertical position. She had stepped behind me. I told her what happened. She said that was odd, that it doesn't usually do that. She pulled it out and put another one. I started coughing again. This time I coughed something up that looked and felt kind of like a baked potato. It was a very large amount. She had been standing in front of me. I asked her if that had ever happened before and she said no. She was kind of cleaning it up but I could tell she didn't want to. Her assistant came in and she told her what happened, intending for the assistant to finish the clean up and dispose of it. The assistant was initially just sitting there on a high stool, very nonchalantly with this attitude kind of like, Isn't that interesting but not really interested. Then she realized that the woman she worked for wanted her to clean it up and dispose of it. It dawned on me that I had inhaled something from our experiment and it was causing this problem with my throat. It was almost as though something were growing in my throat. I had to go tell the others but I couldn't tell this medical professional what I realized because I couldn't tell her about the experiment.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-08-18),-0.16116779,-0.061905846,-0.09786232,-0.027064435
644,"I had decided to do a four-week dream group at the house. Based on registrations I was rescheduling out another week. I had called everyone to let them know but Lou S showed up on the original date anyway. I had just gotten out of the shower because I wasn't expecting anyone. I let her in. she had three children. Two young girls and a boy around the age of 11. They all followed me upstairs to talk to me while I was getting dressed. I grabbed my clothes and went behind the headboard of a brass bed and kind of ducked down so they wouldn't be able to see while I was dressing yet I could still talk to them. Lou S came over behind the headboard as well just to continue talking. I saw the boy moving very slowly and purposefully over to the bed and then he lay down on his stomach facing me. I said, Now I came over here so you could not see me changing. And you purposefully came over just so you could try to see me change. You just get your butt back over there where you were. Lou S said something to him also. He went back over to where he had been sitting. I went ahead and finished changing. As I did another woman had shown up for group and let herself in and came up there as well. I didn't know who she was. I welcomed her but told her we were having group downstairs and we were just getting ready to go down there. At this point I decided to go ahead and have a group for whoever showed up. I said we could all go down and I would come back up and get the folding chairs. Lou S had brought the folding chairs upstairs with her. My house was different than in waking life.

So they wanted to be there as soon as the dance started. I was thinking something about them acting just like they would if it were a high school dance. I was also eating chocolate cake. It was almost like it was packaged - kind of like Hostess cupcakes would be packaged. And the shape was more like that of a Suzie-Q. Those things are so messy to eat as this was.

The second time it was like I was remembering something that happened around there I don't know exactly how to describe that part. Daddy started getting upset because he didn't know what was taking Mother so long. I was thinking that he just needed to stay in one place where she could find us. He finally decided to drive back to where he dropped her off and just sit there and wait. Bob F and I said we would go in and see if she needed help. Then I suggested to Daddy that maybe it would be better if he went in because he was used to helping her and she would probably be more comfortable with him helping her than us. But then she came out, so she didn't need any help. Now it seems that she went in because there was something that she needed to type and post there. While she was doing that I found a little area where they had some small statues and a candle. The candle was like a tea candle in a container that was shaped kind of like an upside down ice cream cone. I lit it. Someone said something about the fact that I shouldn't light it.

She had a baby with her. It was a grandchild. There was a table in front of her. She sat the child on the table. They were both wearing pink. She had this kind of a belt thing that she strapped around herself and the child to keep the child there securely while she talked. She started talking about how she prays. It was at that point that I realized the purpose of this group was to share with the congregation different ways to pray. After she finished I think one or two others shared with the congregation one way that they pray.

653,"I was at some kind of event. Maybe an SAID event. I don't know though. It was close to a meal time. I was going to wait for Macy F to come back and I was going to sit down and eat with her. Prior to that I had something to Bart H about sharing a meal together. He had already eaten, maybe. Anyway, I realized that there was some kind of miscommunication so he would not be eating with me. I think that's when I decided I was going to wait until Macy F got back and eat with her. I had gotten one of my spiritual direction books. I was sitting at a small table reading. There was another woman sitting there. She tried to start a conversation about the Bible or about spirituality, I'm not sure which. I started to respond but then thought, No, I don't think I want to get into this conversation. There was a little bit of silence. A young man came up and talked a little bit then he walked away. Then this woman said something else that really bothered me. It was about God. She continued to talk about spirituality. What she was saying was really bothering me. She said something about God will get what he deserves. I got really angry and said, What does that mean? She said, well, basically she was saying that the devil will send God to Hell. I said, That's preposterous! How could he possibly do that? She said, With his power. I said, But God is so much more powerful than the devil. She said, No he isn't. I said, Yes. God created the devil. She said, No he didn't. So I started talking a little bit about the Bible and how the devil used to be an angel and God sent this angel to hell. Satan wanted God to worship him, etc. I was getting so very angry. I finally just got up and walked away. I thought, this is why I don't get into these kinds of conversations with people. I think maybe Macy F came back and I told her a little bit about what happened - or someone did. I was so upset. Now Bart H is sitting at a table. I went to sit down to there were a lot of people sitting at this table. There was a row. The tables were set up so they kind of formed a half circle. There were five people sitting along one side of this half circle but there was an empty chair in between each one. The people that were sitting there were sitting there to talk about something. They had these things that were circular and tall, sitting on the table. They kind of remind me of the very large decorative beer steins that I had made for Darren while he and I were married. They had these things sitting on the table. I was supposed to sit between two of them to do my talk or someone was supposed to sit between them. I was now talking to a woman who was in charge of organizing this. I told her this would really not work very well for me with those things sitting there. It makes it very difficult to see. If I'm standing in the wrong position I can't see the person sitting there, I motioned to each of the empty chairs. The woman got a little upset but then told the people to sit there items on the floor. I thought, It doesn't have to be either or. There's a compromise here. I finally said, what if they just sit them on this edge of the table, next to themselves, as opposed to the front edge of the table. I said that would be fine. That would not block anything. That seemed to be okay with her and with those people. I think that's what they were going to end up doing. Then I went back to the table where I thought Macy F and I were going to eat. There were two children sitting there eating. Bart H came up. I asked him if this is where I was supposed to eat. Instead of saying yes or no he said, well, that's fine. I said, But this child is sitting there eating. Is that actually my plate and what I'm supposed to eat or am I supposed to wait for this child to get done and then sit there? I was very confused. I didn't understand. Then he also said something that led me to believe that he was still planning on joining me to eat. Then I was even more confused. For some reason I was still going to wait so I went to get a book. He said something to me and I told him that I was just going to sit and read in the meantime.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-08-29),-0.20677306,-0.18605791,0.000565781,-0.19559722
654,"I was driving home. Matthew was in the car with me but he was only about 2 years old. I was getting ready to turn left on Meridian St. The sun was setting and was in my eyes. Just as I was getting ready to make the turn there were maybe 8 police officers that walked into this part of the intersection. I could hardly see them because the sun was so low in the sky and blinding me. It appeared that one of them was kind of blocking the traffic and the others were doing something in the street. A couple of them had brooms. A couple of them were doing something else. They had gloves on. As I thought it was okay and clear I went ahead and started making the turn and then realized that there was another one there walking across the intersection and sweeping. So I wait until they got by and then went ahead. I was in the left lane and drove a little ways. There were more police officers. I had to kind of stop for a little bit and wait until there was enough space between them that I could get into the right lane and drive by. As I did that I don't know how this is possible. After I did that we are now out of the car and walking along Meridian where I can overhear them talking and I can see clearly what they are doing. I realized that I had gone past something where there were one or two bodies covered up with a white sheet. I realized that what they were doing was that someone was murdered on Meridian St and there's blood, a lot of blood, in these two lanes. They are walking along covering it up. I guess they don't want people to see it. As I continue to walk home, I realize that I don't have very far yet to get home. I'm still in the right hand lane and I notice a man walking almost right with me, at the same pace, but in the left lane and back just a few paces from me. I'm carrying Matthew because he is so little. This man to my left, is dressed in a brown uniform. I look over at him a couple of times. Each time he is looking at me. I finally say to him, I'm really scared. He said, Of what? I said, Of whatever is going on. He said, Can I take him? Without a thought, I suppose I assumed this man was a police officer, I said yes, please. During this same time I notice that there are other people walking in the left lane going the other way and that they are also some kind of security, police officers or something, but working related to this same incident.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-08-30),-0.1664049,-0.15287983,0.121817976,0.43139055
656,"I was in California. I think with Ben D. I was there representing a company - for professional reasons. We were on an island. In the middle of the island there was a body of water also. We had taken a boat to get to the other side of the island for a professional meeting or something going on. We were going to meet with I don't know. We got on a bus that was going to drive us someplace else. It seemed to be taking so long. I started thinking that we were going to end up where we started. The road was a very bad road. I was surprised by this. It was very rough and muddy and water standing in the road. Every now and then there was a fork in the road and we would always take the left fork which kept us going around the island. There was a woman sitting close to me. It was almost like we were on a very small bus. Maybe there was only one person to each seat with maybe a little space in-between. I can't figure it out exactly. I looked over at a woman. It looked like she was sleeping but then she opened her eyes. I said, This is really a bad road isn't it? She kind of half-smiled and shook her head yes and rolled her eyes. I didn't say it very loudly. A couple of times the vehicle we were in would slide or skid or fishtail a little bit. I kept praying, asking God to keep us safe while we traveled. Every now and then I would say that. We finally ended up back at our hotel. I said, Well look. We're right back where we started. I was thinking about Ben D's car being on the other side of the island now and how he was going to get his car back. I thought it was silly to ride all the way back there. I think part of me just didn't want to. I thought that maybe the hotel has some rental cars that he can rent and go over there to pick up his car. Of course, then he asked me to go along and while we're over there we can get a room and have a little more privacy. Then we kept driving trying to find where we were supposed to be for this meeting. Now where we are driving is all cement. I was sitting in the right side of this vehicle. On the right side of this street was a cement wall that was maybe 3 feet high. It was a very narrow, very steep spiral. I didn't see how the driver could even see the road in front of him. I was so very scared. I was so scared. I kept praying, rapidly and over and over, God please keep us safe while we travel. I made the sign of the cross. I didn't care if anyone else saw it. I was sitting diagonal to the driver, like in the front seat on the right. I saw the driver hunched over the steering wheel, looking out the windows trying to see where we were supposed to be. This made me even more scared-that he wasn't watching the road in front of him but looking for this place that we were supposed to be. We go into some man's room. I don't know if it's his hotel room. There are papers and things scattered everywhere, on the floor even. Almost as though they were dropped or thrown. One of the men that was with us reached down to pick something up and I said, I wouldn't touch anything if I were you. What if he's been hurt or has hurt himself? I said this thinking that he may have hurt himself because earlier he was talking about his job and how he travels. He sells sports advertising maybe. He has to go all these places and meet with all these people. He has to sit and listen to them talk about themselves and about their careers and what got them to where they are now. He said they just go on and on and on and on. I was thinking that I hope that I don't do that when people ask me about my background - that I keep it very brief and concise. But since he had said that I had the impression that he really was very unhappy in his work. That maybe he went back to this place and committed suicide. Also, while we were in the vehicle traveling, I was thinking about radio advertising and thinking that maybe I should try to get in touch with Bruce S again. Maybe I should try to find out what radio station he is working for. I could see if his station would be interested in the one minute spots that Bill C is talking about doing with someone else. I debated whether or not I wanted to mention it to Bill C.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-08-31),-0.105617784,-0.23596857,0.12554166,0.17530707
659,"I was at a radio or TV station and they were doing some program. I think it was Channel 12. Bob G, the weatherman, and some other man had stepped outside. They were taping with them standing just outside the door. It was winter. He and this other person that was kind of in the shadows was scraping snow off of this van. They were kind of joking around while they were scraping. I don't know exactly how to explain what they were doing. After they stepped back inside it was a DDSI van. Then I found out that it was Joanne N's van and that her and Vince P were there being interviewed, maybe. I was on a platform behind this van and there was stuff sitting around all over the place. I was trying to gently step around this stuff to do whatever it was that I needed to do or to get whatever it was that I needed to get without knocking anything over or breaking anything. I was kind of gently moving these things around. There were two very large bottles maybe three feet tall and dark green glass. They remind me of giant wine bottles. In fact, I think I told someone that they were mine and that is what they were. They were open and at least one of them had something in it. One of them had a wide mouth. The whole bottle was straight up and down as opposed to a typical shape for a bottle. I went and got in a car. I was trying to go home but it was like I couldn't control my car. Now instead of snow it seems that I am driving in sand. It was very white. There was a road but on either side of the road was very deep sand. My car seemed to have a mind of it's own and would speed through this sand. I thought I could at least steer it onto the road and then I would be fine. It took several attempts before I was successful. In those attempts the car would get me to places that were more than just sand. At one place I was out of the car again then. There were these for lack of a better way to describe them decorative scenes set up with statues and things. I kind of reached over one to reach over one to move something a little bit out of the way so I could see it more clearly. In doing so I knocked some angels over. Those displays almost seemed as though they were snow and ice. I said I was sorry, that I didn't mean to knock the angels over. But I don't think there was anyone with me at the time.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-09-02),-0.20062937,-0.00465113,0.1664036,0.03499114
660,"I was in a hotel. I was trying to use the in-house phones to call for someone to help me with my luggage as I was checking out. I tried several different ones. There were square, green, signs on the walls about 12 in by 12 inches in size. I don't remember exactly what they said but some of them said extension 205 and some said extension 209 for services that I thought might be able to help me, but I wasn't clear which one I should be calling. I think I finally realized that 205 was the correct one however I wasn't being successful in reaching anyone. I am using one of the phones that is close to the corner of a wall where I can see the area on the wall running perpendicular to the right of where I was standing. At the end of that wall was the registration desk. There is a man and a woman behind the desk. The woman is also on an in-house phone. She sees me and holds the phone away from her ear and looks at me and shakes her head no. I hang up the phone and walk over to her. She tells me that this is not a public phone. That made me kind of angry that she would think I didn't know that. I thought about explaining to her what I needed but decided against it.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-09-06),-0.194708,-0.007849845,0.1546587,0.037673637
661,"There were a lot of people at my house. It looks pretty much like it does in waking life except that the staircase is open so you can stand at the top of the stairway and completely see into the living room. I was in my bedroom doing something and I overheard Matthew tell someone that his parents had divorced because his mom had left his dad for power or something like that. I went out to the hallway and said, WHAT? He said, Well, that's what dad used to say. Of course, he has changed his story now. I just said, That's ridiculous. I went back into my room. Angie Ho was there and was laying at a diagonal on my bed. I said, If I have so much power I wouldn't be where I am now. She kind of laughed. There are a lot of members of my family there. I went back out into the hallway and was talking about my life. I was standing at the top of the stairway but talking to people who were downstairs, like some of my family. I said, You know, it's like I was watching this show on TV where people asked a friend to help them redecorate a room in their house. They work for two solid days. They work hard. I realized that I do not have a friend in my life that I would ask to help me for two hours let alone two solid days or that I think would do that. That made me very sad. One of my sisters, maybe BJ, was kind of echoing what I was saying, for two hours let alone for two days. As I was headed back into my room I saw that Rachel S was getting ready to take a bath. I stuck my head inside the door and said something. She jumped out of the bathtub. She was all wet. There was something about bedtime. I said, No. You're in there now you might as well go ahead and finish. So she got back in and she was letting the water run and run and run. It was getting pretty high. I told her that she needed to turn it off now. She tried to ignore me. I said, Rachel S, turn it off. Someone else, I don't know who, reached in and turned it off. I told her to now go ahead and get done with her bath. She did. I then went back into my room. Now Mother was in there. She was complaining about something. I'm not sure what. I think maybe she was complaining about one of my siblings and something that she feels that they do all the time that she doesn't like. I said something to the effect that I try not to do that. I have a sense that the fact that I try not to do that irritates some of my siblings, or maybe all of them. Or maybe they don't believe that I try not to. I can't really remember what it was. It was something about communication though like complaining all the time or trying to get people to feel sorry for me or something like that. Anyway, Rachel S got done with her bath and came in and got ready for bed. She went downstairs and as I was getting ready for bed I realized that Mother was planning on sleeping in my bed with me. I wasn't very happy about that but I didn't feel that I could say anything. I knew I needed to get Rachel S put to bed first. I went back to the top of the stairway and told her that she needed to come up and get ready for bed. She asked if she could sleep with me. I said, Don't worry. We have a bed all fixed up for you. I heard a couple of people together downstairs say, Yeah. With her. I hadn't. Mother and I had folded up some blankets on the floor, next to my bed though, and put a pillow there. So she came running in my room and kind of flounced down on there laid down. Mother had put the pillow and blankets very close to the bed and up high so that she came very close to really hitting her head hard and hurting her self badly on the corner of my nightstand. I was thinking that we needed to pull that out so if she got up during the night or when she gets up in the morning she won't hit her head on that. I was concerned that she could hurt herself badly if she hit her head on the corner of that nightstand. I don't know if I actually said it that we needed to move it or if I was just thinking it.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-09-06),-0.18369861,-0.20856757,0.09387488,-0.023837054

The nurse told me how good it would feel but it didn't. It was very uncomfortable and the water was cold. Well, not exactly cold but chilly. Lukewarm at best. I had a hard time changing positions when I wanted to. I was talking to other patients. I would go outside and sit sometimes. Later it became a big fancy house instead of a hospital. Maybe I owned it and was selling it. I had kind of become friends with one of the patients. She and her husband had decided to buy it from me. They didn't think that I would believe them that they really were going to.

668,"There was as trailer truck that had delivered some gardening supplies to my house. I had some left over and so they were returning them to the garden supply store. I guess I had followed him in my car. He pulled up along the front of the store but he stayed in the street. Along one side of the store was a chain link fence. On the outside of the truck was a metal frame. The trailer had a metal frame with canvas sides that you could unhook to get to the stuff that was on the trailer. I had climbed up on the outside of this trailer to unhook the canvass so we could unload the extra stuff that we were returning. I was trying to hold on. There were two places, one at the top and one at the bottom where the canvass needed to be untied. Then there were two places in the middle that had metal clips that you had to squeeze to take off of whatever it was attached to. I was concerned that he had left the truck in the street because I knew it was blocking traffic. I wanted to get it unloaded as quickly as possible. I was trying to hold on with one hand and undo the canvas with the other. I had let go with both hands because I needed both hands to undo the canvas, then I grabbed back on. After I did it I thought it was strange that I didn't fall when I let go with my other hand. I got the one side undone and the truck started rolling forward. I got in front of it and just pushed it with my hands back some so it wouldn't roll forward. As I did this the trailer moved at an angle towards the fence. I actually think it bumped up against the fence. That also stopped it so it roll again. There were 2-3 men that came out of the garden supply store and picked up all of the stuff that I was returning. There were also some little things like little metal clips or something that the also picked up. I think I picked up one of those and the last bag of whatever it was that I was returning. They were all bags of peat moss or mulch I'm not sure. As they grabbed everything and got it off the trailer and were returning it I made the comment that there was one bag of something else that I needed to take with me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-09-13),-0.24949339,-0.035902042,0.08640854,0.13076663
670,"I was with Ben D. We were very close, in a number of ways, though not sexually at all really. We had been laying together, I think sleeping. We were kissing. He got up and straightened his clothes and then laid back down and kissed me again. Then he got up and told me to stay where I was. I was lying on my side in a fetal position. He was going to lay on his back and rest his head on my leg. He said something. There was some confusion as to whether he said he was leaving or leaning. I knew what he meant was that he was leaning. Wherever this confusion came from about leaving I knew it was wrong. It's almost as though it came from someone else - not him. It was shortly after that, that he got up on his knees, I was lying on my back. He leaned over me very close to my face and I think I said to him, I love you, you know. And he said, I love you too. Very much actually. I was quite surprised. I don't know if I was so surprised that he felt that way but that he would say it. I told him that I loved him too. I don't know where we were. But I was at this place that had this water feature in their yard. It was made of several different materials and different levels. At one point you could step onto it and kind of like slide down. It was almost a step effect. They were shaped almost like a seashell so that they had kind of a cup effect but they were really hard and strong like stone and they were very smooth which is what allowed you to slide down from one to the next to the next. I did that a couple of times. Each time I would run back up. One time when I was doing this I realized that there were little water creatures in a lot of these little places. They were like little toads and things. One that was very large had a number of different creatures in it, like fish and other things. As soon as I realized that I didn't want to slide down anymore because I didn't want to step on anything but because I didn't want to feel that against my feet but also because I didn't want to injure or kill any of these creatures. Then I was walking around a grassy area. I felt a rumbling, or moving under my feet. I realized that something was trying to break up and through the ground. I didn't realize until later that it was some kind of a creature. I said something to Ben D about it and he kind of dismissed it. I said very firmly, NO! There is something trying to get out. When I said it so seriously he took it seriously. He knew what it was. It finally broke through. It was an ugly beast. Not really ferocious but yet dangerous. I just took off running away. I didn't get very far until I realized that Ben D had stayed. He had stayed to fight this beast to keep myself and the other people around safe. This creature was kind of being almost teasing or taunting at first. I had these feathers in my hair. They represented some kind of dedication to Ben D. Someone handed me a red feather and suggested that I go running through this area, waving this red feather, because this would cause this creature to get more angry and to chase after me. When I did this, Ben D and whoever was helping him would be able to defeat this creature so he would no longer be a threat. I was afraid but I decided to go ahead and do it so I would be doing my part. The first time I ran through I did it so quickly that it just barely riled the creature. He knew someone had run through flashing red but that was about all. So I was getting ready to do it again when I woke up.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-09-15),-0.0015498789,-0.18104011,-0.4686555,-0.084052056
678,"I had gone on a trip with some family. I know Bev was along but I don't know who else. There were at least three of us sharing a hotel room. When it was time to start packing to get ready to go we were all rushing around. I kept asking if I had time to take a shower before I left. I said something about the fact that I was going to be traveling for so many hours that I really wanted to be able to take a shower before we left. I finally decided that there was time. So, I got all of my stuff together and put it on my bed so I could pack very quickly after I finished taking my shower. Then I found my toiletries and went to take a shower. The showers were in a big common area and both genders took their showers in this big common area. The showers were square, cement stalls and the opening was just big enough to get in if you turned sideways. They were only about chest high. They were so small that you barely had room to move. I wondered how in the world people were supposed to take a shower in this. There was no shower head. It was almost as though it filled with water. I was reaching down and bringing the water up with my hands to try to clean myself. I really wanted to wash my hair. I was trying to figure out how I could do that in this kind of shower. Then I realized that I had forgotten to bring my shampoo with me. I asked someone to go get my shampoo - maybe one of my younger nieces - maybe Rachel S but Rachel S as 8 or 9 years old. She asked me if I could use hers. I told her that was fine. She had it right there handy. At this point though I'm sitting. There is a pool of water by my legs so I'm reaching down and cupping water in my hands and bringing it up to my head to try to get my hair wet. I put the shampoo in. I don't remember finishing though. we are all getting all of our suitcases together and putting them in this one area. This area is my birth home. We're pulling all of our suitcases and stuff into the garage. I come through the breezeway and I'm headed into the garage. There are some kind of little things sitting on the breezeway. They almost look like little burial plots about the size of Barbie dolls. But they looked like they were made to some of them had. I don't know how to explain this. They were kind of like statues of saints but they were laying on the top of these. I asked someone what they were and they said that Bill F had made them. About that time Mother comes up and has these boxes that are about the size that two of these dolls would fit in. She said something about finding them. She said they were storage boxes for her Barbie dolls for her to keep Barbie dolls in that she hasn't sold yet at a garage sale. We were commenting what a fancy way that was to store those dolls.

The four of us were in a car going somewhere. Ed was driving and Molly was in the front seat with him. I was sitting directly behind him and Carol was behind Molly. Ed was talking about something that he did. None of us could believe that he had done that. I reached up and tousled his hair with both of my hands and said, You silly man. He ran his fingers through his hair. I was afraid that I had irritated him or made him mad - that he didn't like it that I tousled his hair. He didn't say anything though. Carol laid down in the backseat and put her head on my lap. I reached down to brush the hair out of her face and accidentally rubbed her face roughly or the wrong way. She jokingly said something to the others about me being rough. I also had a sore on the ring finger of my right hand. It was kind of inside where it would rub against the second finger. It was a big round thing. It was too large to be in that spot on a finger. I had been messing with it. It was almost as though it was a wart and I had been picking and pulling at it and I had maybe pulled it out myself. It hurt a little, but not that much, not as much as you would expect it too.

686,"I was driving a car in a parking lot. It had places that were blocked so you couldn't drive through. I saw one vehicle going out another way. At first I was going to try to get out a different way. Then I realized that the other way was either the best way or the way you were supposed to get out or maybe the only way. I finally headed that way to get out onto the road. It was almost as though the road was a country road. It had been raining a lot. The rain had broken out the pavement. On the other side of the road there was a stream but because it had rained so hard the stream had broken through the pavement and continued across the road into this parking lot. I was driving through this parking lot to get to a place where I could pull out onto the road. There were big breaks in the pavement where this stream had broken through. I tried to also avoid these very large potholes and places where the pavement seemed to be buckled and piled up. As I was sitting and waiting to pull out, it must have been dusk because the cars had their lights on. The driver in the car behind me was becoming very impatient. There was a lot of traffic. I was going to be turning left so I was waiting for an opening large enough for me to be comfortable pulling out. Finally, because of the car behind me, I always get worried that they are getting mad at me if I take too long to pull out, so I finally just took a chance and pulled out very fast. I did make it okay and didn't cause or get in an accident.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-10-17),-0.034464158,-0.15377843,0.15699978,0.3960773
687,"I was working at BCC. We were driving to work, myself and another woman. As we were pulling up we were talking about the one circular drive that people can use to drop someone off or executives can park in the one parking lot off the circular drive. We were talking about the executives only thing. We went to the regular employee parking lot and parked. Myself and this other woman were both wearing business suits. We were walking down the sidewalk to the door. For some reason I got behind her, she got a little bit ahead of me. I had some papers in my hand and my daytimer. I started to run a little to catch up with her. As I was putting my papers in my daytimer. We started skipping. To catch up with her I had to pass a businessman in a suit. We started skipping. I laughed and said, look at us skipping to work. We liked our jobs and were happy to be going to work. This man caught up with us and started talking very surface stuff about going to work. He wasn't very excited about going to work. Apparently his department wasn't doing well. We said something like Well, you should work in our department. There was something about the fact that his department wasn't doing well, wasn't meeting their numbers or something and our department was, plus we said we work in the best department anyway. He said, Really? You work in chocolate? We said, Yep! As we got in the building, he smiled and went through another door to get to his department. We had to go through a different door to go up to our department.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-10-18),-0.30669686,-0.099971846,-0.020979753,-0.036525954
689,It was winter. I was in a parking lot and the cars were covered with a couple of inches of snow. I saw Doctor W. I was maybe 1000 feet away from him. I wanted to quickly get my car cleaned off and leave before he saw me or could approach me and talk to me. I didn't get done in time. He saw me and headed towards me. I think I got in my car anyway. He said he wanted to talk to me and I told him that I really didn't have anything to say to him. It seems that this happened twice before I got away but I'm not sure how that could be.,elizabeth.tsv,(2003-10-19),-0.10353461,-0.1864971,-0.23822618,0.21833396
690,"Matthew and I were in a car. Someone else was driving. We were in my mother's hometown. I don't know why we were there or where we were going. We were about to pass Grandma H's house and I wanted to point it out to Matthew. We went by it too quickly and I wasn't able to. There was an old house that was very rundown, maybe even a lot of fire damage. The owner was selling it because they didn't want to put the time and effort and money into making it livable again. It seems that maybe BJ bought it. We were driving and I was thinking that there was a house on 3rd Street that was significant. I don't know if it was this one. I kept thinking that I wanted to go by it, maybe to point it out to Matthew. We ended up at this house, I'm pretty sure BJ is the one who bought it. At one point in the dream she is talking about going ahead and moving in right away, as is. Maybe she could live in one room that wasn't too damaged. There is a man. I don't know if it is Uncle H. I think it is because as I'm watching him and following him around this house I'm thinking that he looks so much like Grandpa H. I don't know that he really did because I don't remember much about Grandpa H except the pictures that I have him. I just kept thinking how much he looked like him. I remember seeing him walk up a stairway to another floor. I don't know if he is showing us around this house or if he is just checking it out with us. If he is doing it there was a problem with the plumbing maybe. Maybe we heard noises or rattling that made us think there was a problem with the plumbing. We went into the different rooms. Some of the rooms BJ was going to turn into different kinds of rooms. She might change the old kitchen into a bedroom. She was going to make one of the other rooms the kitchen. The house was still full of stuff from the previous owners. I don't recall seeing furniture but lots of boxes and just a mess.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-10-21),-0.13383275,-0.25048864,0.030077292,0.09060519
692,There was something going on in my home. There were two men who seemed to wander in and were wandering around the house. I asked them what they were doing there. I don't know if I heard the answer or if I just don't remember the answer. Maybe I got distracted right away because of whatever else was going on. Later I saw them again and asked them again. This time they said they were with the phone company so one of them picked up a phone like he was working on it. I was clearly aggravated and asked him if he had a supervisor that I could call. They said sure and handed me this thing that looked more like a calculator than a phone but I guess it had the supervisor's phone number in it. I walked away thinking that was ridiculous. They could have that set up for me to call anyone and the person on the other end could be in on whatever they are doing and just pretend to be a supervisor with the phone company. I decided to look the phone number up in the phone book and call the company that way to see if these men were who they said they were. I don't know why they were there even if they were with the phone company because I wasn't aware of having phone problems.,elizabeth.tsv,(2003-10-21),-0.27049044,-0.071329266,-0.02752518,0.08595298
696,"I started out running some kind of errand for CAS on my way to work. I started out going across town as though I was going to visit Jennifer K. At some point though I headed downtown. I was at a place where there were two lanes in the street going each direction. There were a lot of parked cars along the sidewalk. In some places there wasn't enough room for another car to drive in the right lane, where I was. Yet, I somehow managed to get by without getting into an accident and without hitting any other vehicles and without being hit. There were a couple of times that I didn't know how I managed that. At one point there were a lot of big puddles of water in the street and another time it seemed as though it was piles of snow. Later it seemed that I was on a bicycle instead of in my car. At that point I was trying to figure out how to get to Jennifer K's from downtown. I was at an intersection. There were a number of men standing there. Some of them were smoking cigarettes. One of them asked another for directions. I wondered if I should ask the same man for directions to Jennifer K's. I hesitated and finally decided not to. Then I was riding my bike down this street. It seems that the other people were walking. I was having a really hard time getting traction on the snow and ice. I think someone behind me realized that I was struggling to get traction and so, and I'm not sure if it was a man or woman though I think it was a man, they pushed me until I was in a place where there street was clean and dry so I could get traction. I wanted to turn around and say thank you but I knew I wasn't good enough on a bike to be able to do that without stopping or losing my balance. I decided that I would have to just yell thank you and keep going but I don't recall actually doing that. I kept going and got to a point where I stopped again because I wasn't sure where I was. I thought that if I could get to 38th and Kessing well twice I was trying to figure out how to get to 38th street. I knew I could get to Jennifer K's from there. I was at 38th street but I didn't know the cross street so I still wasn't sure. I kept going and I finally got to a point where I thought I knew where I was. There were a couple of women or girls standing there. I asked them to clarify where I was. The one who answered me made it more confusing. I finally said, Yes, but if I go over this bridge then there's a McDonald's to the left and what used to be a T.J. Maxx store and there is a movie theater to the right. She looked at me oddly. She said, McDonald's yes. T.J. Maxx I don't remember ever being there. The movie theater, yes. I thought, Ah. I know where I am then. That's where the SFI store used to be. I didn't say anything else to her. I got back on my bike and headed back out. I was still lost. I ended up in this place where there were some people who worked for a candy company. They were delivering these boxes of candy to these different stores. I ended up by a very odd little store. It was as though it was located at the top of a ramp and it seemed to be kind of an open-air place. I don't remember there even being doors on it. It was a store full of snacks and candy and stuff. There was a box of this candy there. Someone came in and asked if they knew if this was supposed to be for them or for another store in their company. The man who was working said he had no idea. This candy was a combination of candy and ice cream packaged together. Like two separate things packaged separately and then together or attached together. I left there and ended up in this place where some women were working around a lot of boxes of furniture. They were involved in remodeling an office. They had twelve pieces of each of these different kinds of furniture. They all looked alike. Some woman came up and was talking about a round table that was there. She said she didn't want that in her office. The other women told her that every office was supposed to get it. She said, Yes. But I don't want it. They said, Okay. That's fine if you don't want it. I think they gave me directions too, because I think I was still lost. I got back on my bike and started out again. Then I ended up at a place where there were three men working. They might have been construction workers but I'm not sure. They were working on something where they were attaching pipes to each other or to something else. They had copper colored pipes. The things they were using to attach them were copper colored kind of rubbery pieces but yet they clamped them tight to hold the pipes together. One of them was explaining this to me and I said, Yeah, it's an okay job. I saw that it wasn't clamped tight enough in a couple of places and I kind of use my thumb to peal it back. I thought it wasn't going to work very well. He kind of laughed at me as though I didn't know what I was talking about. I just ignored it because it wasn't that big of a deal to me. I was actually there to ask them for directions and telling them where I was trying to go. They said, And you're on a bicycle? I said yes. They said, Why don't you let us do you a favor and take you there? I almost cried at that point because I was so frustrated and I really didn't want to be on my bike anymore and I didn't want to keep trying to find it and not being successful. I said, You would do that for me? He kind of looked at me like, Well, Yeah! Kind of like, why wouldn't I? Then this other man said, Excuse me. I got the impression that he was maybe the supervisor and it was up to him to make such a decision. I looked at him and he said, That's fine. We'll be happy to do that. I said thank you. I started talking to him. I really liked him. He seemed really nice. The other man seemed like the kind of man that comes on to every woman that crosses his path. The other man seemed like a genuinely nice man so I talked mostly to him. Then I thought, You know. I wonder if he would just take me home. I'm so tired and frustrated. Even when I talked to the women I almost cried because I was so frustrated. I realized that I would have to tell him where I live and they will probably say something like, You mean you got all the way over here from there on your bicycle? But I just thought how much I really wanted to go home. I was going to ask him if he could just take me home.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-10-26),-0.115396425,-0.20584087,0.14228863,0.38950226
698,"I was working for a company that the first part of my job, maybe to get started working for this company, I had to see a certain number of people and present this photography package to them. I wasn't expected to sell any of them but I had to present them. One of the places I went to present was in St. Joe. I decided to go to Cliff S's house. It looked different than it does in waking life. They had a long sidewalk that came all the way out to the edge of the road. It seems that I was walking. I think I saw somebody outside across the street. I said something about going to Cliff S's house. I think they suggested against it but I decided to go anyway and see if they would allow me to present to them. They invited me in and were going to allow me to make my presentation. Mother and Daddy were either there already or they came over or maybe they came with me. Sc's had me go into the living room and wait for them. They said they would be right in. They had a lot of family photos all over the room. I was looking for a current one in particular because I was curious as to what Cliff S looks like these days. I saw one and thought that he had aged well, that he was an attractive man. They came in and we were talking a bit about their children. There was a young man there named Simon. He was twenty something with very blonde hair. It was one of their children. He walked out of the room and I said, I know how old Simon is but it's hard for me to see him and believe that he's that old because I remember him when he was just a toddler. I was doing my presentation. With Daddy being the entertainer that he likes to be kept making jokes and wisecracks. I was getting really frustrated. Even though I knew I didn't have to sell any of these it would have been nice if I could. But he just kept joking around and stuff and I ended up not selling anything. After that I feel like I was asleep yet I was thinking about Cliff S and back to grade school and his interest in me and the way I was so shy and afraid to reciprocate any interest. I was wondering what it would have been like if I had been brave enough to go out with him. It was eighth grade and it would have been a date with his family. I didn't even ask my parents if I could go.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-10-27),-0.22620863,-0.050463546,0.16417132,0.040779468
699,"I was in a hotel. I was sharing a room with three friends. One of them was Jo V. Someone had chained us up. There was a man named David [unknown in waking life] . He had thick long dark hair and dark eyes. He was very attractive. He was trying to talk our captor into letting us go. He wanted to make love to me. We were laying on a bed and we were kissing. He wanted us to take the shackle off of my ankle. I managed to get loose and we got away. We did make love. When it was time to go home I didn't want to leave and I didn't want him to leave. I had fallen in love with him. I hugged him and he picked me up off the floor. We hugged very tightly. I told him I didn't want to leave. It was at that point that I realized he had no attachment to me at all. He didn't seem at all bothered by the fact that I was leaving. He was saying that I didn't want to be involved with someone like him. Maybe he even had some kind of bad history - criminal history of some kind. I was staying on the 32nd floor of this hotel. A couple of times I got on the service elevator. I was trying to get back to my room. I was on the 11th floor. It was a very small elevator. It probably didn't have room for more than three or four people. It was very unusual in the way it operated. When I was already back to the 32nd floor it stopped. As I was getting ready to get off it went up a little further, then it dropped back down a little past the 32nd floor and then back up to where it should be for me to get off. There were a bunch of people standing there waiting to get on. I went back to the room. My roommates were all packing and getting us ready to leave. They hadn't packed my stuff but they had put it all together. I walked out of the room. There were a lot of other people in the hotel that we knew. I saw Terri O come out of her room. She was getting ready to leave as well. Towards the end of the day it seemed as though someone had done some investigation or something of David. It seemed to be that he was connected to Daniel R or Nick R. I'm not sure which. One of them had given them my name as someone he could sleep with easily, be intimate with. I was so furious. When I went and tried to find out if he knew Daniel R, I think it was Daniel R, he denied knowing anyone by that name. A little bit later, I was doing some other packing but I wasn't in the room at the time. Maybe I was just consolidating some things that I had already packed and trying to make things easier to carry. He came up and sat down next to me. I didn't want to have anything to do with him at that point. I had nothing to say. It was as though he wanted to talk to me about this but yet didn't know what to say. I was sitting there. I had two bags of turkey deli meat in clear plastic bags. They were each slices that were rolled up. I was combining them into one bag. I had no desire to talk to David. I woke up at one and then went back to sleep. We were on a beach and there was a huge wave. It scared the heck out of me because I thought as it was coming into the beach that it was going to go right over my head and completely put me under water. Fortunately it didn't. It did cover some people, but it's height diminished before it reached me. It washed way up on the beach beyond where I was standing, but it wasn't any deeper than my knees.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-10-27),-0.14275609,-0.2881547,-0.40273932,-0.046446934

He spoke very briefly with the person that I was with and did little more than acknowledge me. I was a little confused, hurt, or disappointed by that. It seemed unusual because Doctor C often said that Doctor B spoke highly of me. Later I was by myself and ran into Doctor C. I was surprised to see him. I said, What are you doing here? It's Thursday afternoon. You should be golfing. He said, I know. He was not as upset as I expected him to be with working on a Thursday afternoon instead of golfing. He did say something about not being happy about it. There was also something about the sleep center staff.

701,"I was standing right inside the window of one room and Bill C was standing inside the window of another room. The room that he was in was a bathroom. He had just gotten out of the shower so he didn't have any clothes on. He looked different than in waking life. He was much heavier and even in the face didn't look the same. We saw each other standing inside the window so he called out of the window from the room he was in and through the window of the room where I was. But then we saw in a distance that Jane C was there. So we got concerned and he quickly went back. Tried to quickly get back without her seeing us. I guess maybe she was headed towards us. She didn't catch us. The place where we lived was my home now in waking life. I had come home and the front door was open. But it looked like something was going on next door also. I wondered if they were getting it ready for someone new to move in. It looked like they had put black blinds on the windows. I noticed those and thought how nice they looked. But my front door was standing open. I hesitated at the door trying to decide whether to go in or not. I realized that it was the maintenance men that were in there. They had brought in a lot of equipment. You can hardly even get into the kitchen. At some point I wondered if I was finally getting my new windows but I don't think that's what they were doing. There were a lot more than the 3 or 4 maintenance men that work here in waking life. Tim U is the only one I recall from waking life. Maybe the other men were subcontractors. As soon as they saw me they realized that they had forgotten to put plastic down on the carpet before they started coming in and out and working there. As a result there were black footprints all over the carpet. They quickly started putting something down on the carpet. They put some of it down on top of the black footprints. Now Jane C either came in or was there and I just noticed her. She was using a vacuum and cleaning up the black stuff on the carpet. We were trying to figure out how to get rid of these clones of us. We decided that we needed to use a time machine and travel back in time. We realized that the three of us needed to travel together. Myself and whoever I was married to and our daughter. We would go back to a period in time that we had visited previously and created this clone, we went back to that period of time. We would find them and not tell them why we were there. I don't know that they even realized that we were clones or that we were from a different time or anything. We had to come up with a reason to get all three of them in the same room and standing next to each and very close to us. As soon as we did that something happened that took a second and they just disappeared. Whatever we did took a split second and they disappeared. It seemed that there were a lot of different ones all in one time period. It was almost as though we realized that all of the clones existed in one time period and we realized that we could get rid of all of them at once if we could get them all in the same room at one time. So we had done this but we also realized this time that some of the clones looked very different. Like the teenage daughter in one of these clone families looked like a very old woman and she was maybe only 3 feet tall. She had shoulder length, full, grey hair. In the face looked like an old woman. The way she walked and carried herself was very much like an old woman. She is the only one that I remember specifics about the differences in appearance. It was at that point, where we had gotten them all in the room together, and we started making them disappear one family at a time. We were doing quickly enough that it didn't cause a problem.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-05),-0.1926903,-0.22883853,0.059770957,0.028574724
703,"I was a member of some branch of the armed forces. I have no idea or what branch or where I was serving. We were in a thing that looked kind of like a big building - almost like an empty warehouse. There was nothing in it. There were bare boards on the ceiling. A bunch of us had gone into this building. Shortly after we got in there we realized it was sitting on some swamp land or something so it started sinking. We weren't able to leave so we were trying to do other things to try to get to the roof, or to try to keep ourselves safe until someone got there to rescue us. I was hanging on to one of the bare boards on the ceiling. I wasn't just holding on to it with my hands but also had my legs wrapped around it and kind of hanging there. When I realized that wouldn't work much longer I noticed a window or opening of some kind on the wall near me. I managed to get the window opened out by the latch. I was able to pull myself out and onto the roof. I was able to survive that way. Myself and another woman survived. I don't know if anyone else survived or not. Because we survived this ordeal we were being given honorable discharge. I was excited to find out that I was going to be able to go home early. There was something about one year but I don't know what that had to do with it. We were back where we were living or staying. It wasn't like an army barrack. It was more like individual houses or apartments. This other woman had survived, I think maybe she was married or involved with someone. She was anxiously awaiting the return of her partner. She had taken a shower. She had long black hair. She came over to my house right after her shower. Her hair was still wet. She said something about having a party. Maybe jokingly said that everyone had to come to the party naked. Later her and I are talking to a couple of men. One in particular I seemed to be getting along especially well with. I think I invited him to this party. He said there was no way he could go to a party where he had to show up naked or where everyone would be naked. I had somehow convinced him to come anyway. We kissed. It wasn't a long romantic kiss. He was sitting in a lounge chair and I just leaned over and gave him a quick kiss on the lips. Later, I saw him coming to the party and it turned out that it wasn't that we had to show up naked. I saw this man coming and he had a T-shirt on but no pants. I ran out to warn him so he could go home and finish dressing. He went back and finished getting dressed. I think he was younger than I was. Maybe this is why a romantic relationship didn't even occur to me. But we did get along really well. I really enjoyed talking to him. Somehow the idea of romance came up. I started entertaining the thought simply because of the way we got along. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be romantically involved with someone younger than myself. I don't know how much younger he was, if it was significant or anything.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-08),-0.056274123,-0.20129283,0.20293298,0.23449627
705,"There were a lot of characters. Ben D was one of them. He asked me to marry him and I think I said yes. After we were married he was telling me certain things that he expected. My first reaction was that I should have known that before I married him because I don't know that I would have. My second reaction is that it wasn't that big of a deal and that I would be able to adapt with no big problem. But it was as though there were these, I'm trying to decide if the whole thing had something to do with SAID. It feels as though some or all of it had something to do with some kind of criminal activity. Not all of it. Just some of it. It's as though there were different, for lack of a better description, rooms or places that you would go for some reason. Each place was built. They weren't connected. They were built on the water. I think they had the capability to move. But they weren't like boats, not even like houseboats. Maybe kind of like an enclosed dock. That seems to be the closest I can come to describing them. One of them did seem to be something like a houseboat. Somehow, but I don't know how, we moved from one to the other. Almost a sense of jumping across from one to the other. Maybe they were just far enough apart that you could just step across but for some reason I felt the need to jump across. There was a child that needed to use the bathroom. I agreed to take her. It wasn't my child. I had to take her from one of these to another. I wanted to do it without being seen or caught. I don't think I was guilty of any criminal activity but maybe I was a witness. There was some kind of criminal activity or somebody that would have wanted to capture me to keep me from saying what I knew. Those people were in this one place where I had to take this child to go to the bathroom. I thought I had gotten there without being spotted. We closed the door. Just as I closed the door someone on the outside of the door did something to lock us in or to keep us from getting out. I didn't panic. As soon as it happened I started looking for alternative ways to get out. There was a very odd kind of window. It didn't open like a normal window. It didn't even really look like a window. But I identified a way that we would be able to get out through there. While I was doing this child was going to the bathroom. It was a little girl. As she finished I realized that she had been standing in something like a bathtub or shower stall going to the bathroom. As she did this the water level in the toilet was rising. This is so odd. I asked her why she did that but I don't remember her answer. She didn't get her shoes wet or anything doing this. As soon as she finished we flushed the toilet and everything was fine. It's as though we did this twice. I can't remember how it was different the second time or enough to give a description that makes more sense.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-10),-0.07944157,-0.044664707,-0.0899394,-0.093982995
706,"I had decided to purchase a condominium. I think I found one advertised in a large hardback book. It was about the size of a large dictionary. The community had a specific name so I got out a map and looked up the name. The weird thing is that it described it but it was also the name of the community. I went there and walked into a sales office. There was a woman working there that was about my age or maybe a little older. She was very thin, had blonde hair and wore glasses. She was the only one working. Initially she didn't say anything to me though she had glanced up at me but then kept working. Finally she did look up. I told her I was there to look into the condo that was for sale. She got her keys and took me to see it. I think we just walked. At first I was unsure. We had to go upstairs to enter the front door. She was telling me that my neighbor was an older woman with MS. She said I would hardly ever see her but that there is one person who comes frequently to see her and help to care for her. I would see that person but otherwise she was a good neighbor because she is quiet and does not have a lot of people coming in and out etc. Where you enter was kind of like a covered patio outdoor area. There was a sitting area. It had some roses there that were dying. I thought I could try to save the roses. I thought it would be a nice area to sit and read and such. The woman then showed me another area. We looked over or through or something to an area that was an outdoor area that was not covered. It seems as though we had to look through some wood slats to see this area. This area was about the size of a car. The floor was wood and not level. It had a high slope. I couldn't figure out what it was and I don't remember what she told me. Underneath it was storage and she said a basement. I asked her if I could see it. She told me I could but we went inside first. As soon as we walked in the front door I knew it was the place that I wanted though right now I can't remember anything about the inside or why I knew it was the place for me. She showed me around. I was carrying this big book with me that had the condo listed. I also had my checkbook and a pen with me. I set those down on the kitchen counter I think while we looked around. After we finished looking around the inside I told her I was pretty sure this was the place that I wanted but I wanted to see the basement first. There were some maintenance men there. I asked her how soon it could be available for me to move in and she said two weeks. She said the maintenance men would need that much time to get it ready. This is unusual for a condo unless the owners hired these men to do some work. One of the maintenance men was taking me to see the basement. I was wearing a somewhat short skirt. We had to go down a wall ladder. I was nervous about going down this ladder anyway but especially in this short skirt. He went down first and then held out his hand to help me down. I think I handed him my book and checkbook and pen. Then I went down. I remember asking someone or saying to someone that it didn't seem that there were many families with small children in the community. They smiled and chuckled and said no there weren't families with young children in the community. They said it was mostly people my age and ten or 15 years younger or older. Someone asked me about my son. I said he was 18 and I told him he was a student at PLU. I don't know if I said he was a junior.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-14),-0.29466856,-0.12191828,0.22385284,-0.11490409
707,"Matthew and a new girlfriend. It almost seemed as though I, and maybe someone else was trying to rescue him from something or maybe this girl and we had to get him away from campus. I think we believed that Michelle [unknown in waking life] was going to do physical harm to Matthew if he left. Chris H was there. At one point it seemed that I was observing and someone else was the mom. The mom had gotten a job as a housekeeper in the sorority house that the new girlfriend, Michelle, belonged to. She did this to have access to cause some type of problem. She was in a room with several of the girls and sprayed something on them and into Michelle's eyes. She than ran to escape the house. They announced an alert over a PA system. This was to lock down or stop the mom from escaping. Some of the girls didn't know who they were trying to prevent from escaping and it did not occur to them that it was the housekeeper. As the mom reached the front door there were three girls there locking the door and saying something about the escapee not being able to get out that way. It was a very nice, expensive house. The front door was a beautiful dark wood with a window pane running vertical alongside the door. Since they did not expect the housekeeper to be the one they were trying to prevent from leaving they let her out. As soon as she got out she ran for a car that was waiting for her. There were a lot of people in the car and they had created a disturbance around the car to make it easier for them to get away. There were also a lot of people outside the car to help with the escape. Some ran behind and hung on to the back of the car as it pulled away so no one would be able to get a license plate number. It seems that maybe they even started a fire. As the car drove off we drove into tons of traffic. We were worried that they would be able to catch us now, but then we realized that my significant other had arranged this for me to help with the escape because as we drove all of the traffic moved out of our way and then back into place to prevent anyone from getting to us by following us. The cars that were moving were sitting at all types of angles and directions which made it seem more impossible for anyone to get through. There were also people standing along the road cheering us on because they wanted us to be able to get away. I ended up alone at a bus or train station. I thought it was a bus station but the ground area somewhat resembled train tracks or a train station. I don't know what happened to the other people who had been in the car with me and I don't know what I did with the car. I was trying to figure out how to get home from there, but with my car. I didn't want to take the bus/train. I was trying to decide if I could/should ask someone at the station and if so, who. It seems that I did but they either couldn't tell me how to get home or told me that I had to take the bus/train. During the rerun of this part of the dream someone gave me directions and I was with someone but I don't know who. They drove from there. We came to a part of the road that was completely under water. I could see not far up ahead that the water was very active and it looked as though we would be driving off the edge of something. I was scared and brought it to the attention of the driver. By that time it was too late but it turned out we just couldn't see beyond that point - not that it was a drop off. We kept driving through the water and made our escape. I don't think Matthew was with us though. In another rerun of this part of the dream it did drop off and I don't remember anything beyond that. In the first run of this part of the dream, when they told me I couldn't drive away from the station they did give me some kind of directions. This time Matthew was either there or showed up, with a male friend. We followed the directions given to us. We came to this area where the ground area looked like a huge wooden slide with several lanes. Almost like a six or eight lane highway but they were varnished wood lanes to a slide. People sat and slid to the end. Along the right side there was also a chain link fence and a cement walkway. Some people chose to walk down this path. It was a little difficult to walk because it was so steep - difficult like it would be if you were trying to walk down a steep hillside. I think I decided to walk and Matthew and his friend were sliding down. I was keeping up with them to a point and then I seemed to get ahead of them. I lost sight of them at one point and became very frightened that something had happened to them. They finally showed up at the end. At the end of this path there were some people from the college working. The student mailboxes were there also - they looked like regular house mailboxes, black metal. I opened Matthew's and looked in. There were lots of messages for him written on sticky notes. There was one larger one that was to stay in the mailbox at all times. It was kind of stuck to the mailbox so it hung down in front when you opened it. You removed it to remove the rest of the mail and then you put it back. There was a young man who removed it while I took the rest of the mail/messages out and then he put it back and closed the box. I was looking at the notes and then passing them on to Matthew. I think some of them were either from or about Michelle. Maybe there were some of each. There was also a female attendant there. She was responsible for some metal boxes that we had to put change into. Before we could leave or move on. We had a pile of change that we were talking about or doing something with when we realized that some of it had to go into this metal box before we left. It needed a quarter and something else. There was also something about Ashley B. This seems as though another rerun part of this dream where just parts of the dream occurred more than once but in slightly different ways. The escape to the car was one of those but I can't capture the details now. We were in a room and Chris H was lying down. He must have been lying on the floor because I needed to get around him and warned him so I wouldn't step on him as I stepped over and around him to get what I needed. He moved a little and at first I thought I was going to lose my balance or step on him because of that.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-15),-0.19245967,-0.10583274,0.10656854,0.07028341
710,"I was at a CIIS intensive. Jo V and I were checking in at the same time and had taken our luggage upstairs. To get to the room upstairs you had to walk across a very narrow walkway that seemed to drop off to the left. There didn't seem to be a rail or a wall there. The floor was hardwood. The wall to the right was a row of windows. The ceiling was less than five feet high so I had to bend over to go across the walkway. There were also hanging plants every so often that I had to dodge. We learned that our room was actually downstairs so we went back down. For some reason Ben D was there. I heard that he was wondering why I was avoiding him or not giving him any special attention. I thought to myself that it was a two-way street. He could pay special attention to me and didn't. He hadn't initiated any communication in months so why should I pay special attention to him? Later we were at a group meeting and Liz C, came in riding in a very small motorized race car that was primarily blue in color. I thought it was great. She was using this as an alternative to the scooters that many people use when they have limited mobility. I was thinking that she traded in her wheelchair for this. But she did get up and move around some once she arrived at the meeting. Each day two or three of us were supposed to facilitate or lead a group exercise, meditation or prepared. I was excited about the one I had prepared. When it came time for me to facilitate my exercise, someone else in the group arbitrarily decided we didn't have time and got majority agreement to postpone it until another time, but there wasn't another time for me to do it. I was somewhat upset by this. I felt it was disrespectful yet didn't surprise me. Later that day Liz C and someone else were sitting on the steps, in looked like my home now, and talking about the fact that everyone seemed to be greatly lacking in motivation. Liz C asked me what I thought about it. I said I had missed most of that evening's meeting due to my lack of motivation. I didn't mention what had happened. She asked me to go upstairs with her and help her come up with something that might improve motivation. I agreed, though I wasn't sure I was the best person to help her. Later I was in my bedroom, again it seems that I am at home, and Bill C came to the door and asked if he could step in and talk to me. I said yes. He was speaking in a very low voice so as not to be overheard. I was having trouble hearing him so I asked if I could close the door. He hesitated for a moment because it would be inappropriate for he and I to be in my bedroom alone with the door closed. I agreed. What might others think if they knew? However, since we both knew it was totally innocent we closed the door anyway. We talked for just a few minutes. We were in a mode where we were really connecting, laughing and enjoying our conversation as occasionally happens. A couple of times he stepped very close to me as we talked. I found myself having a desire to kiss him, or for him to kiss me, and felt the same coming from him though he didn't say it. I knew we wouldn't because we both knew it would be inappropriate. Still, I was disappointed when he left the room. In another scene I am sitting at a small square table talking to Audrey T. She was trying to talk her office landlord into creating a courtyard for tenants. I had told her some time ago that our office building had something like this and I had talked them into fixing it up for tenants to use. We could go out there and sit in quiet, to have lunch, or to have a conversation with someone. So far Audrey T was being unsuccessful and wanted to know if I had any suggestions. Bill C came up and sat down. I introduced him to Audrey T. I started to explain what she does for a living but admitted that I could not do that very well so asked her to explain to him what she does. I was expecting her to tell him about her work with women and unions but she didn't. When I said something about that she said that she hasn't been doing that forever. I was embarrassed that I didn't know that.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-15),-0.22279485,-0.13457534,0.008073395,0.1871587
713,"I was at John Mu's house. He and his wife were in bed. He motioned me to come into his bedroom. Their bed was the width of a twin size bed but the length of two beds. They were sleeping feet-to-feet. I didn't even realize that she was in the bed until he started to introduce me to her and she poked her head out from under the blanket. They invited me to stay. We were in the living room watching a movie. He and his wife and I. He sat really close to me, right next to my left side. It made me very uncomfortable. His wife got up and left but I don't know where she went. Then he tried to get even cozier. Maybe he leaned his head against me. We were eating popcorn. I think I was trying to be nice to make up for the bad parting that we had in waking life. I had my hand interlaced in his arm. I was surprised when I realized that my head was leaning against his shoulder. I moved immediately. It was dark in the room. I could tell he was getting ready to reach over and put his hand on my leg or knee. I was getting very squeamish because I did not want him to touch me. He reached over and I gently pushed his hand away. I was wearing a skirt. He said, Oh come on. It's not like I'm going to reach all the way up or anything. I was still trying to be nice so I smiled and said, Sorry. I don't do that. He tried again and I pushed his hand away again. Then four children came in. Two of the teenage girls, with blonde hair, were his daughters. The one teenager was a boy and then there was a younger girl. He introduced me to them. They started watching the movie with us. The youngest one had long dark hair. I think I playfully tossed a pillow at her and it landed on her stomach. She got really upset. I apologized. I crouched down over her. She was lying on the sofa. She said she didn't feel good. I said again how sorry I was. She started crying. John went to do something and I just decided that it was time for me to leave. I picked up my purse but I didn't think I should leave without saying anything to him. As soon as he came back in the room I told him that I thought it was time for me to go. He started to protest and I just said, No. I really need to go. When I went to leave I saw my car was covered with a heavy layer of white dust or dirt. I think earlier we or someone had been doing yardwork and it was from the yardwork. I was parallel parked in the driveway between two other cars. I opened the driver's side door very carefully so all of this stuff wouldn't get in the car. I shut the door and started the engine. I was revving the engine really hard to blow all of this white dust off so I could see to drive. As I did this it shook the car a lot, enough to move it in a position where I could easily drive away. John came out and was going to try to stop me but I pulled away. It seemed that he and I worked for the same large company. I had a discussion with the owner of the company. It had nothing to do with John. I think it had to do with an idea that I had for the business. He kind of liked the idea and had suggested that I handle a certain part of the project. A couple of other people were standing there and questioning why I would want to do this. I was said a couple of times, No. I would like to finally be recognized for being the one responsible for this. I didn't come right out and say it or was hinting at the fact that at previous companies I had made significant contributions that really benefited the company but other people got credit for it. So this time I wanted to do it again and I wanted to get credit for it. I don't think that was the only reason I wanted to do it though. There was a rumor going around. A lot of employees were getting worried that they were going to lose their jobs. It was in some way related to this idea I proposed. It wasn't true but the rumor got started and everyone was getting worried. John was one of them. He was still kind of after me. The owner found out about that and was trying to help me. Maybe he was trying to protect me or keep John away from me. I was now maybe back at John's house and I was trying to get out without him seeing me. He would spot me and come running after me. I kept trying to hide and get away from him or stay far enough away that he couldn't touch me or anything. The owner of the company showed up and was doing something to try to help me. I smelled incense and realized that the owner of the company had lit this incense because it was in some way supposed to help me or keep John away from me. The owner of the company told me that he loved me. That made me very happy. I don't know that I said the same to him. The next thing that I remember is that it seemed as though there was a flood. It was as though you were looking at an ocean where you couldn't see beyond the horizon. There was a long boat. It was not a good thing. John threatened or in danger. He said, Oh. What the heck. I'm going to go ahead and get on that huge penis-shaped boat.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-17),-0.085512765,-0.3270321,-0.25951943,-0.0013796561
714,"I was in the office working with Bill C. We were talking about something very personal. We are now employees at a hospital. He has a discussion with someone about how easy it is for him to access someone else's sperm. So he was going to make sure I got pregnant by someone else's sperm. I had called and was having a fun conversation with him on the phone. He didn't know it was me and was getting a little upset. I finally said, I'm teasing you. It's me. Right after that he tells me that he loves me and that he is perfectly okay with that. I tell him that I love him too. He is in an accident or something and ends up as a patient in the hospital. I was frantically trying to find Bill C. I did find him and he was being treated. He had a tube down his throat, a neck brace, and all kinds of other paraphernalia on and around him. I got as close as I could to his face and spoke to him. He looked at me but couldn't speak because of the tubes and things. Now it seems that instead of Bill C and me it is David Letterman and someone else. There are some other people now and they are conspiring against the woman that David is involved with. David is wearing something that looks like coveralls and lying on a loft type bed. He is lying there with someone else - a woman. Someone has placed them both there as part of a conspiracy. They get into an argument and fall off the bed. They just fall maybe ten feet to another loft bed. The same thing happens again. Now there is a third person lying on the loft bed below them. Now all three of them fall. I think as the top two fall they knock the lower one off. That person falls a far distance and gets seriously hurt. Maybe more than one of them. I'm not sure it is David or not. I'm also somewhat confused, but don't know why, as to whether it is David or if it is Bill C. Next I am with Diane S. I'm trying to make or keep her OK or feel better. We're staying at an event and we know a lot of people at this event.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-17),-0.22446217,-0.04103028,-0.45676297,-0.07076432
722,"I was working at the CAS office. I was working on something related to curriculum. I thought it would be important, after completing it, to sit down with the instructors to tweak it. I had completed the draft and realized that while I didn't know if Bill C would be the one presenting the training I thought I would go over it with him. He was in his office but the lights were either off or very low. He had come into my office. I had piles of paper neatly spread out but covering my desk. I handed this document to him and said something to him about it. He got angry and said, I told you I wanted you to work on _____ - something else but I don't remember now what - and that I just wanted you to concentrate on that. I said, I had been and I just needed break so I worked on something else for a little bit. He just walked out. I was very upset about it. It was in the afternoon and people started arriving for a training program. I went down to the Deli because I hadn't had lunch yet. I stopped at the women room on the way. I was talking to two other women in there. They were both single. We were talking about going somewhere. Someone said something about men. The women room was a huge room. At the other end of the room was another room and her husband was with her. They said something like, Now wait a minute. And then said something about talking about men that way. I said I wasn't generalizing that I was talking about a few specifically from my experience. Myself and another woman left and we went down to the deli. Someone there asked if he could help me. I said I wanted a turkey sandwich. He brought me this very large round platter. He had a lot of tomatoes and onions and lettuce and a pickle. I thought, Oh wow. I should have told him that I wanted this to go. I started digging through the pile of tomatoes and found the turkey. Then I thought I needed to go ask him for some bread because I didn't tell them that I wanted it to go. As I continued to dig I found one round piece of bread, like half of a bun. Then I found another that would be the middle slice of a three-part bun. I finally decided that was good enough, that I would make my sandwich out of that. I wanted something to drink. Since I was upset I decided to get a regular Sprite. Before I left I had dug through my purse to get a bunch of quarters to pay for it. I realized that they had made a lot of changes in the deli - maybe even different ownership. Now instead of the soda machines that they used to have they had one soda machine that dispensed cups of soft drinks with ice. I went ahead and put my quarters in. I saw they had diet Sprite so I chose that. As I saw it coming out I suspected that it was Mountain Dew rather than Sprite. I took one sip and could tell that it was definitely Mountain Dew. I got a little anxious because I know how little Mountain Dew it takes to affect my nervous system. I told whoever was with me that I had to go up to the counter and get this taken care of. I went and told one of the women working there what had happened and that I could not drink Mountain Dew. They wanted me to just be okay with the Mountain Dew. I told them that I really couldn't because it would have such a strong negative affect on my nervous system. I really couldn't handle it physically. They said something to a young man working there to have him taking care of it. The deli was really crowded. There were a lot of tables. It was much larger and much busier than in waking life. There were people at every table; there was a long line of people in the food line. As I was standing there, there were many desserts there and they looked very tempting. I thought that I needed to get away from there so I wouldn't indulge. There was another man there that worked in the building. He was wearing a white shirt and tie. He was saying something to me, looking around the room. There were a lot of men in the room, all wearing white shirts and ties. He said something about all these men dressed alike - something about the mentality of it is the best way I can describe it.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-21),-0.29730448,-0.05224039,-0.20386222,-0.110975325
723,"I was offered a job in another city. I was having incredible difficulty reaching a decision about whether to take the job and move or stay. Matthew was quite a bit younger than in waking life. We were talking about the decision just as we used to discuss decisions that affected both of us. I had finally come to the point where I thought - I just wanted to know what God wanted me to do. I had finally come to the decision that God wanted me to move. Some of my family members came to the house. Even Darren was there. Bev and Rachel S were there. I started telling them what treasures they all are to me and how much I value them and my time with them. However then I was going to tell them that I was going to take the job. Several of them had brought me cards and letters. I opened the first one and started to cry. I still thought that I should take the job. Then I started struggling with the decision. I didn't let them know that I had thought I had made the decision. Someone delivered several large bunches of white tulips that were from different people, some family. In the dream these were my favorite flower. I was struggling. I told them that I just wanted to be very clear about my decision and that I wanted mostly to do what God wants me to do. I was asking him to make it very clear to me so I would know what he wanted. At this point one of the men from the SDI, I think his name is Rob, he is a minister, suggested we say a prayer. He said a prayer aloud. At the end of the prayer I thought I was supposed to go and I started crying again. Oh, maybe this is when the tulips arrived and they were a farewell present. I said I was going to take a walk, thinking that would help clear my head so I could make the decision. Several times I thought the message was that I should go and that alone should tell me that I was supposed to go. However, also, if I keep having these serious doubts that I'm supposed to go maybe that is what is telling me that I'm supposed to stay. There was something I saw. Bev and some others were singing a song and dancing. Bev had really long hair in the dream. She was wearing a very pretty suit with a skirt, vest, and jacket. The jacket looked like a tweed. I wondered where she learned this dance. It was like a choreographed dance. I wondered where she learned it and why. I also had a suit on with a skirt. I had a pair of biking shorts on under the skirt. Jody S and Kim H saw I had the shorts on under the skirt and wondered why I was wearing them that way. They were helping me straighten my clothes because my blouse was rolling up under the skirt. I did finally decide not to take the job. Instead I was going to move into Mother and Daddy's beach house, which they don't have in waking life. It was located behind their house, almost as though their house was on one side of the block and the beach house on the other side of the block. I said that would be a good thing to be living so close to them yet in a different house.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-22),-0.011935072,-0.23629755,-0.033001427,-0.055585265
724,"I and a female friend went to a week long conference. We met two men. I met Russell Crowe and her I don't know who it was that she met. He and I both had other plans that were cancelled. As he came out of one room I didn't even introduce myself, just grabbed his hand, put it on my shoulder, turned around and said let's go get some coffee. He didn't even know who I was or anything. He just smiled and followed me into a dining area. Two or three people that he knew joined us right away. They started talking to him and didn't bother to introduce themselves to me. I didn't even get to say another word to him - to introduce myself to him or anything. Some people that I knew came in so I slipped away and sat at a booth with them, right behind the booth he was sitting at. I thought I would wait until he was done with his friends and then rejoin him. For some reason I decided to leave. When I came back he was sitting with Matthew, waiting for me. I thought that was so cool. I sat down. Matthew was much younger. Matthew walked away I think. We finally got to talk just a little before we got interrupted again. He kept really making an effort to spend some time getting to know me. There was something about chocolate cream pie. I think he kept trying to get a piece for me because he thought I would really like it, but someone else kept taking it. He was just being very persistent about getting this for me.

727,"We were traveling on 465 and getting off on a GI exit. We noticed an accident at the end of the exit ramp. It was too late to avoid going by there. I got to the end of the ramp too fast and I was worried about making the left-hand turn where the police were directing the traffic. I did make it okay. Unfortunately, they didn't have detour signs up yet so it was up to each driver to figure out the detour. At this point we are walking. I'm with Matthew. There are some other people ahead of us. Some behind us. We're all trying to figure out which way to go for a detour. We ended up back where we were. They had now cleaned up the accident and we could get through. However, now it was the hallway in my house. There was a woman behind. There were some men that were still cleaning up. This woman either wanted to get some information from me or give me some information. She walked in the room. I think it was the master bedroom. She was saying how uncomfortable she felt there. I told her that there had just been an accident there but I didn't know anything about it. She kept saying how uncomfortable she felt and that she really wanted to get out of that room. There was a picture on the wall that had some feathers on it. She made some comment about one of the feathers that was primarily royal blue but had a few white streaks in it. There were a number of people standing there and she kept talking about that feather. I finally said to a couple of people, do you want to hear where I got that feather? A couple of them said yes. I said, One day I was lying on the floor, (I pointed to a doorway between two rooms and indicated that I had been lying in that doorway across the beige carpet), so as you can see the pillowcase was white and the floor was very white. I had been taking a nap. When I woke up the blue feather was there, kind of out of the blue. Where it had come from, especially when everything around me was white, I have no idea. Uncle A was standing next to me and said something about that being very spooky. Now it became even spookier to me because this woman had something, told us some story about the significance of that feather. I'm wondering if someone was injured as a result of that accident.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-24),-0.2745517,-0.21199852,0.1649405,0.21018468

Jane C was there also but she looked different than in waking life. She started being critical of him in front of everyone. Apparently she felt that he had been rude or mean or something to several people and she was saying things like, Don't contact them. Don't make any attempt to speak with them. Then she got up and walked away. There was a woman sitting next to me but I don't know now who it was or if I knew her in the dream. I leaned over and whispered, I don't think they're going to last.

741,"I was driving around my mother's hometown. Like I always do in my dreams where I'm driving around my mother's hometown, I drove by Aunt P and Aunt H's house. I saw two of my cousins children. I think it was Debbie Wo and Susan W's children. They were outside the house. I had driven by the front of their house, the house was on my left. I turned left to the left side of the house. I thought since Susan W and whoever she was with wouldn't expect to see me in my mother's hometown they probably wouldn't recognize that it was me in the car. I decided not to wave and just go on by. Now I see them in this very run down apartment complex. There was a very narrow staircase on the outside of the building to the front door. This place is a mess. I think Debbie Wo and Susan W or one of them are thinking about moving in there. I think they are both single - never married and no children. I went into the apartment. There was an elderly man sitting in a rocking chair. I can't remember who else is in the apartment with me. He was a heavyset man with gray hair, tousled. I'm hearing or being told or realizing that Linda W and Dick W are separated. I keep thinking how difficult it must be for Dick W to be asked to leave his home after so many years of marriage. He is really struggling with this because he didn't want the separation. Now it seems that maybe it's him that's living in this place. Maybe this old man is Dick W. Now I'm living in this apartment complex or whatever it is. The master bedroom is very much like my waking life bedroom as far as where it is in the apartment and size and such. One day I came home, now it's a two-story townhouse just like I have in waking life, I open the door and shut off the alarm. I hear a loud noise upstairs. I'm sure there must be someone up there so I'm very frightened. I stand there for a couple of seconds and call out, Hello? Hello? I'm thinking that whoever is up there will leave, though I don't know how they could leave without going by me since they are on the second floor, or they'll answer me. Nobody answered me. I didn't hear anymore noise. I finally got up the courage to go upstairs and don't see anyone or anything. I don't know now what caused the noise and wonder if it was just my imagination. A little later I noticed that both of the windows in the master bedroom are open about 6 inches or so and the blinds are open about that far also. I'm so sure that I did not have them open. Now I know that someone was in my apartment, even though I had the alarm set. Then I'm thinking that I need to call the apartment office to see if someone from maintenance had been there. First I go to the window to close them and lower the blinds. But the blinds seem to be broken on both windows. When I turn around I realize that all of my CD's and DVD's, maybe ten of each, are all gone. I had kept them on a lower shelf of the TV stand though I don't in waking life. The blinds aren't broken but the cords had been cut. That's when I realized that someone had broken in through those windows, stolen by CD's and DVD's and that's all they got. That's what I heard earlier when I came in, them getting back out. In waking life I noticed this past summer that I can have those two windows open and still set the alarm. So I thought maybe someone could break into those two windows without setting off the alarm. I think I reported it to the police. I went back home and had a pile of forms or papers that had names and phone numbers. I decided to go through it to see if there was anything there that would help me to identify who had broken in. I found this one with a phone number that was just one digit off from another number that I had. I showed it to someone else that was with me in the apartment. I said, This is who it was. For whatever reason, I had identified that it was this person because of that phone number that was off just one digit. Like instead of it being 2226 it was 2262. They just rearranged those digits to be able to break in. Anyway, I told the police about it. They told me that was good kind of investigative work that I had thought of that, found it, and identified it. It turns out that this person lives in this same complex. Then I'm overhearing Susan W talk to this older woman who lives there in the complex as well. They are outside talking. The older woman said something about leaving to go to the store. I go up to her and say, You have to be careful. You can't be outside talking out loud about where you're going or when. I told her that my apartment had been broken into and that it had been someone who lived in the complex. They obviously had been paying enough attention to my comings and goings that they realized that every Wednesday morning I go to work.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-12-09),-0.14838426,-0.28316516,0.16852771,0.10957593
742,"I was in a hotel along a beach. I had opened the sliding glass door and stepped out. I realized that I had stepped out onto an enclosed balcony that had maybe two other doors, one to the right that would prevent people from the room adjoining room from walking across your balcony and there was a door to the front that gave you access to the beach. On the left there was another hotel room but that end was not closed off. Both of these doors on the balcony were open and I had left the sliding glass door to my room open. There were some children playing and they had kicked a ball into my room. A little girl with blonde hair ran into my room to get it. She looked around my room for something else. I told her she needed to go because I needed to go back inside and get ready to go out. I went out to the other part of the hotel. It was packed with people. I was on my way someplace and had to step aside because a group of people were coming out of the restaurant towards a meeting room. As I was standing there a few of them recognized me. They were very excited to see me. They hugged me. They were both male and female. I recognized them as a DCC class that I started with as a Graduate Assistant and then realized that I just could not manage the time and had to back out of my commitment. I said to them, Unfortunately I recognize the faces but don't recall the names. I'm so sorry for that. They just laughed and were really glad to see me. As they were walking by they each hugged me. As I was hugging each of them I was congratulating them because they were there for their graduation. I remembered one name so as I hugged him I said, Congratulations Mike Mu. You're the one class member whose name I remember. But don't tell anyone else. He said, Oh. He was flattered that I had remembered his name. The oh was kind of like oh shoot. I can't tell anyone that you remembered my name? I didn't get to hug all of them. They went into their room. I went in also. They were trying to get ready for graduation. I had my hand in the air and waved at some of the others and softly saying congratulations. They were getting seated. There was a lot of equipment around. Maybe someone was videotaping or maybe it was a sound system. I happened to have my camera and tripod there. There were a couple of students that had their point and shoot cameras. I told them I would be happy to take some pictures for them. They said that would be great. While they were setting up I was getting my camera set up. I was going back and forth across the room. I got my camera out and then realized that I needed something from my bag on the other side of the room. This happened several times. It was challenging each time because there wasn't much room to walk between the back row of chairs and the back wall. Each time I was struggling to get by or asking people to scoot their chair up so I could get by. I went up along the left side of the room because Harry B was the instructor and was sitting in the front row. I went up to get his attention to say hello and let him know that I was there. He said hello and that he was happy to see me. He made a teasing, yet serious, remark about the fact that I had not kept my commitment. Somebody was questioning my ability to take pictures. I told them I was just a beginning photographer but that I had done a few photo shoots.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-12-11),-0.16175744,-0.24244475,0.13893224,-0.12610716

I'm debating about having a conversation with him, that it's time for him to either move out or at the very least move into a different bedroom. He could tell something was bothering me and he asked me. I finally said, I'm just debating whether I want to have an unpleasant conversation with you right now. As I continued to unpack my closet is pretty full so I asked him if he had thought about either moving all of his things into the spare room or something else. He was not at all happy about that suggestion. There was something about Christmas decorations. Darren had been lying on the floor on his back while I was unpacking. He said something about if he could help. I said, You know, you've just been lying there while I have done all of this. I think it would be fair at least if you could get up and help with this. He got up and started putting his clothes on hangers. I was taking them and putting them in the closet of one of the guest rooms. All of his shirts he was putting on a hanger but he wasn't buttoning the neck button. So I was having to straighten and button.

751,"I had called Doctor C. He suggested we get together for a drink and to catch up. I was talking to someone and telling them that I was going to do that. I'm at home now and preparing for him to come there. I had called the maintenance men and asked them to come and work on my chain lock. I needed to get it fixed before he got there. I stressed to them the importance of them getting it completed before Doctor C got there. They made a comment about why it was so important. I said something about him being a pulmonologist. They made a comment about doctors thinking they are so important. I said that he is a pulmonologist and a lot of time he does save people lives. If he gets paged the hospital expects him to show up immediately. He showed up. I greeted him at the door. The door reminded me of the back door of my birth home. I opened the door and greeted him. Before he walked in he leaned in and gave me a little kiss on the lips, but kind of like you would with family or a good friend. It wasn't at all romantic. We were both sincerely glad to see each other again. There was a woman intern with him. They wanted to change clothes. Doctor C didn't even ask where to go he just went ahead like he knew where he was going. I directed the intern to a second bedroom where she could change. They came out. We were sitting in the living room talking. This is my home but it's not familiar to me at all. Doctor C was saying that there was something different about me. I told him that I had lost 35 pounds. He said something about it being in addition to the 23 that I lost four years ago and I said no. I told him that unfortunately I had gained that back plus some. But I'm back now because of lifestyle changes so I can keep losing and keep it off this time. ",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-12-16),-0.2807175,-0.07966833,-0.36548388,-0.07538479
753,"I met my future husband last night. His name is Sal [unknown in waking life] . I had my laptop sitting on my bedside table and it was connected to the internet. I started chatting with him online, though I don't know who contacted who or how we found each other. Online he called himself Sal CEO. Our first interactions were fun and playful. Within a few hours he had arrived at my house to meet me. He is fairly tall, has reddish brown short hair, wears glasses and medium build. He is a very nice man, and fun to be with. I was sharing a home with Darren and with Maureen U from the sleep center. They were married and lived primarily on the first floor of this home. Sal and I wanted some time alone to get to know each other but he was very nice about the fact that Darren and Maureen U were there. They were each dealing with some kind of problem in their life, each separately, and he was being very kind in allowing me to do what I needed to do for them. We were both engaging in conversation with each of them about whatever it was they were each dealing with. He noticed a bumper pool table across the room and suggested we play. I told him I didn't know how and he would have to teach me. I went over to the table and realized that there was a piece missing or something and told him we couldn't play because of this. He suggested another game that the four of us could play. We were preparing to do that. I noticed how dirty the tile floor was. It was covered in black footprints. I said something to Darren and Maureen U about it, almost scolding them, telling them that they could be a bit more conscientious about taking care of my home since I had agreed to let them stay there temporarily. I lived primarily upstairs while they were staying here, but shared some rooms of this floor. That's why Sal and I were down there instead of going upstairs. While we were getting ready to play this game Sal and I found ourselves alone in a room for a few seconds and he gave me a quick kiss on the lips. I could tell by the look in his eyes that he was going to do that before he did. It was nice. It was especially nice because it affirmed to me that he was enjoying being with me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-12-22),-0.22358595,-0.058105946,-0.4573225,-0.15665409

When we took a break to do this I didn't stand up to connect with someone right away so I had to sit and wait for someone to be free. As soon as I saw one woman sit down - finished - I asked her if she would take the photographs of me. We moved around to different places in the room. There was one place that had grey curtains. It was almost like a stage area. I was going to sit on the edge of the stage and have the grey curtains in the background. She didn't like the grey background. There was another place where the walls were kind of a cream/beige color. She thought that would be a better background. We went over to that area.

756,"I went over to Lakeland Dr to the old house there. I saw a woman in the living room, feeding a baby. She had another child that was a little bit older - maybe 5 or 6 years old, a girl. The room was pretty messy. There was a screen door. The door was open so I walked up to the screen door and I asked if I could step inside for a second. She said okay. I could tell she was a little hesitant because she didn't know me or why I was there. I stepped inside and said, My name is Anna. I used to live here. You don't know me obviously. I wondered if I could just walk through the house. She said it wasn't a very good time that they really hadn't even closed on the house yet. I said that was fine, that I understood. I put my hand on my chest and was fighting back tears. I said that it was okay and that maybe I could come back another time. I left. As I got to the front sidewalk another woman came out. She was the owner of the house - that was selling the house. We talked a little bit. I introduced myself and told her the same thing - that I used to live there and that I really just wanted to walk through the house. Her husband came out. We were all looking down the street and talking. They said that they had had trouble selling it and ended up selling it for less than they had hoped. I said I had the same problem. I was divorced. Actually, what I said is that we were going through a divorce so I just had to sell it. I told them the neighbors had gotten upset with me because I sold it as low as I did, but that I really didn't have much choice because I had to sell it and move. We had a nice talk. They both gave me their business cards and in fact the woman gave me two of them. She had two different business cards. They told me to give them a call in a few days and they would see if they could arrange for me to come over and walk through the house. There was a third person there but I don't know who she was or what her connection was to all of this. Now I'm standing at this outdoor sink. There's an attachment on the sink, kind of like the ones you would pull out to spray and rinse out the sink. I was doing something with that. It wasn't exactly like that though. It was a hose and the end of it looked more like a garden hose. I had put something in the end of it and was thinking about that.

766,"Matthew and I were driving back to the city where I live from St. Joe. As we neared I-465, nearer to the city, you could see the skyline. In the skyline there were two very distinct buildings. One was directly in front of us. The other was off a little bit to the left. They both had very large words on top of the buildings. I could read them from there. We were talking about the buildings, what they were, which one was tallest building in the city. I decided that the one to the left was in my way, was blocking my vision while driving so I reached up and bent it over, almost a U shape, to the ground. That didn't break anything. Now Matthew is a very young child and it's the fourth of July. We're on our way to see the fireworks. My intention was to find someplace close to home, on the way home, to just stop and watch the fireworks and then go the rest of the way home. Matthew was pouting because he wanted to go over to the west side of town, to some place where I knew it would be packed with people to watch fireworks. I had to call Darren for some reason. I was trying to be very nice. I wasn't sure how he was going to be with me on the phone after my latest emails when he got kind of miffed at me. I was still being very nice. He asked me how I was and I said fine. I told him Matthew was pouting. Darren said something. I guess I didn't realize that he wanted to talk to Matthew. Then he said, No. I'm not kidding. Put him on the phone. I gave Matthew the phone. Apparently Darren said something to him about pouting. At this point we were laughing. We weren't in the car anymore and there were a lot of people around. I was trying to explain to Matthew that it was going to be so crowded and uncomfortable and it would take us so long to get out of there after the fireworks. I let Matthew talk to Darren.

772,"An actor was in town at a local establishment, maybe a restaurant. He was engaging primarily with me and the people who were traveling with him. I don't know why me. When I first saw him I thought, Oh, I've always liked this man. He always seems like such a nice man. I don't know who it was though. I have the name Benjamin Bratt in my head but I know it wasn't him and I haven't paid much attention to him in waking life. Anyway, he was going to be doing a kind of impromptu singing performance and he wanted to sing primarily to me. He pulled a wedding or engagement ring out of his pocket for a prop. He asked me if I liked it. I said I did. The ring had one large diamond in the middle and was surrounded by two rows of smaller, yet not small, diamonds. The ring was not a full circle - it was adjustable. I put it on the ring finger of my left hand. I took it off a time or two and put it back on. He was sitting across from me, maybe at a table. I put my left hand on top of my right hand, somewhat outstretched in front of me. My hands were tan. I checked my nails to see what kind of shape my manicure was in. They looked fine. I think I did this more than once as well. It seems that after that he was maybe sitting on a stool, or some chair that made him higher than me. He was still sitting in front of me but he picked up my hands and laid them on his right leg. I don't remember seeing the ring on my hand. Some of the other people there were envious that I was getting all of his attention. There was nothing romantic about it but there was something about me that he found endearing and comfortable maybe.

I was thinking that it was odd that as much as I like flowers and plants I didn't especially care for this one. I was studying it and began to think that I could really learn to appreciate and enjoy it. As I was doing this Bill F had a hand spade and was digging up the plant. It seemed to be several separate plants in the one planter. He was digging them up and separating out the individual plants. Someone asked the name of it. They said it was some kind of orchid. It didn't look like an orchid does in waking life. I can't remember the name now but at the time I thought it was such a beautiful name and it gave me a new appreciation of it.

778,"I was in my mother's hometown. It was in the evening, dark outside, and cold. I was walking but I don't know why I was there or where I was walking. Somewhere along my walk I put down my coat, my scarf and my gloves. Later I realized that I had picked up by scarf and gloves but had forgotten my coat. I don't know how that is possible since it was cold outside. I was now in some kind of a store. There were two young women, late teens or early twenties, working in the store. They were putting cards of earrings on a circular earring rack. I had the impression that one of the two women had made at least some of the earrings. I pointed to them and told her those will sell very well, and I was basing that on either having sold a lot of them myself or knowing about a store that sold a lot of them. I had actually ended up in the store by accident and wanted to go through the store to get someplace else. The store was pretty crowded and messy. Now I was carrying something like a plastic laundry basket, oval and very pliable, and it had something in it. I was kind of pushing it together as I saw aisle after aisle crowded with stuff and thinking if I squeezed the basket together I could get through the aisle but kept avoiding trying. One of the women finally came over to me and pointed out an aisle that was clear. I went down that aisle and out the store. When I had first entered the store the women seemed to not be very nice - as though they didn't want to talk to me. They didn't seem to appreciate what I said about the earrings. After I left I thought of something else and went back and just stuck my head in the door and told them what I was thinking. It was something that I thought was either good advice or another affirmation of something they were doing. This time they seemed much nicer and seemed to appreciate what I had to say - like they were really going to use my advice. After I left the store I came to WHHHS, which is not in town in waking life. Again, I went into the building to go through and try to get to where I was going. I got lost in the school and found someone and asked them how to get to an outer door. When I got to that door there was an older woman there giving another woman directions. After she finished I asked her for directions for where I was going outside the building. She gave me directions and they seemed simple and easy to follow. After walking for a little while I either got lost again or was no longer sure that the directions were correct or that I had heard them correctly. I decided that I would walk to Aunt P and Aunt H's house and ask them to drive me to help me find my coat and my car. I don't know why I wouldn't just ask them to help me find my car and then I could drive around and try to find my coat myself. I came to a place where I couldn't go further as I thought I would be able to. I saw Mother and asked her how to get to Aunt P and Aunt H's house from there. She told me to just down a couple of blocks to Dair, go right on Dair and I would know where I was. I don't know why I didn't ask her to take me, why she was there, why she was outside, or anything like that. As I started walking towards Dair I looked at my watch and saw that it was 8:40 p.m. I knew I had to hurry because I didn't want to be knocking at their door after 9 p.m., especially if I wanted them to drive me somewhere at that hour. I began to run the few blocks to Dair Ave. When I turned right on Dair I found myself going through buildings again. It seemed that I was going through a private office, or maybe the office of a little hotel.

At first I hesitated to say anything because I feel that they expect me to know a lot about spiritual life. I finally decided to go ahead and ask in such a way that maybe they would think I was just interested in knowing more about her experience or that I just didn't understand what she said. Bev looked at me and kind of laughed and in a critical tone of voice said, you don't know what a PE Circle is? It had something to do with something vocal and yet there were four things and maybe there were two options of groups of four things. I say things because I have no idea what these things were. Somehow these things impacted the vocal quality of whatever this was. I had chosen between these two groups of four. I had chosen the four that gave the lesser quality. This sounds extremely weird but it almost seems as though they were chairs. I had decided to paint the backs of these chairs black.

Parts of it were melted and parts of it were very thick so where I was driving was very uneven and rough.

I've never heard that term before but I assumed I knew what he meant. I said that I was sure he would enjoy that. Then the building started to collapse again and everyone began to run. Ben D was still behind me with his arms around me. He barely lifted me off the ground and began to run. My feet didn't even touch the ground. Someone told us not to even turn around to look, to just keep running. We kept coming to places of water and I kept saying with panic that I can't swim. It was as though we skimmed across the water. This happened several times. Finally, we heard the building come crashing down behind us. After we were sure we were safe we stopped. We were just at the edge of the demolished building. Where we were standing was by a type of corridor to the building. It had not crashed completely to the ground. I saw people in there who had not made it out. I started reaching in and helping people to get out. After everyone that I could reach was out I saw that there were more people in there so I went in far enough to reach the others. They had been injured, but all of them were in a seated position with their legs straight out in front of them but they were bent way over towards their knees, a sort of yoga position. But they couldn't move, even though they had room to move. I reached for each of them and slid them out by the boards they were sitting on.

It was 4:45 and the wedding was supposed to start at 6 pm. I was getting panicky. Someone was using my shower. Someone else told me that I could go to a friend's apartment and take a shower there. I went there and started getting undressed when I realized that all of the walls were windows. Even though they were opaque people could still see in. I was trying to find furniture that I could duck behind so people couldn't see me getting undressed. The apartment was very close to the street so there were people walking by. I was taking some newspaper. I think I was only naked from the waist down. I was trying to cover my breasts so people couldn't see them. I think BJ was with me. She was pushing buttons on the wall that were supposed to lower some window shades. There was a woman standing outside and saw us putting the shades down. She signaled to BJ not to do that. I think BJ must have signaled back to her. When she got the idea what we were doing and why she was okay with it. We got the windows covered. BJ told me to go ahead and start taking my shower. She was going to go get my toiletries. The shower was circular, on a platform and very, very large. It looked like a circular stage. The shower head was in the ceiling. There was a shower curtain that pulled around it. I hadn't turned the water on yet. The person who lived in the apartment was standing there now. She said something to me so I stepped out a little bit from around the shower curtain. BJ showed up with my toiletries and stuff. Jody S, Kim H, and Matthew were all there now too. I was trying to get started taking my shower and Kim H wanted to take some pictures of BJ. She got in my way so that was postponing me again from taking my shower.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-02-21),-0.16561909,-0.19741185,0.09537409,-0.14027114
795,I was at the CAS office. It didn't look the same as it does in waking life. I was near the kitchenette area. There were two jars sitting there. They were clear glass with no labels and with lids. I tried to loosen the lids on each one and couldn't though I didn't try very hard. Bill C walked up just as I began to try so I just asked him to open them. He opened them very easily. I said that I don't usually have difficulty opening jars. Then I wondered why I said that and why it was important and why I didn't try very hard. One jar had lemon drops in it and another jar had hickory nut halves. I took one lemon drop and one hickory nut half and put them both in my mouth at the same time. Bill C walked away while one of us was saying something to the other. In a very short time I put two more lemon drops in my mouth. I was thinking something about him seeing me eat these lemon drops and what he might be thinking about that when I had been doing so good on my weight loss plan last year. It made me uncomfortable for him to see me eating these lemon drops.,elizabeth.tsv,(2004-02-23),-0.16374984,-0.010596006,-0.056021515,-0.03050121
798,"I was with family but I don't know who's house we were at. Jim D called and then showed up. I was so thrilled to hear from him again and to see him. It was nothing physical. He was there visiting with me around the family. We had shared a couple of meals together. At one time he and someone else was hungry so I went to McDonald's for them. When I came back I was putting their food on plates. I noticed that the french fries were not done well. They were very soggy, not crispy. This is odd because I thought before that they said they wanted me to go the little Chinese place around the corner from my house. Jim D left and called me at work and left a message on my voice mail. Part of his message said that our voice greeting was too confusing or long or complicated. I went to tell Bill F and he got a little defensive and didn't like it. I said that Jim D had been in the voice mail business for many years and I just thought I would pass it along.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-02-28),-0.28403157,-0.06440757,-0.14882089,-0.12430308
799,"I saw John Cusack, the actor. There were maybe three other men. I was working for Gary S. There was some thought or discussion about our past relationship. I was thinking that I knew better than to do that again, especially now that we are working together. Him, these three men and myself were trying to get more information about something wrong or bad that was going on in some bar or restaurant. I think we set up kind of a sting so we could go in and catch the culprits. Gary S was going to be the target. The rest of us were just going to be in the bar watching. When the bad men made their move we could move in on them. I don't know what we were actually going to do. I think it was a bar but it was very well lit. It seemed to be in the middle of the day. We all went in at separate times so no one would know we were together. When I went in I walked around looking for a seat next to one of the men I was with for safety, but I couldn't find one. I walked out and came back in and finally spotted one. I went up and acted like I didn't know him and asked if I could sit in the seat next to him. There was another man on the other side of the empty seat and there was very little room. I had to squeeze myself in between them to sit down. My arms were against each of them. I don't know that anything that we expected to happen actually happened. I think the place emptied out but I don't know why. Now I think there is another woman with us. We were all standing and something started to happen that felt somewhat like an earthquake but not really. We knew that wasn't what was happening. We all huddled together and were holding onto each other tightly so we wouldn't get separated. I was standing and I was looking at the floor. It started changing colors and the colors were swirling. I realized that time was changing. As soon as it quit, I guess I must have closed my eyes, I opened my eyes and saw that we were now in a diner - kind of a 50's diner. We were all dressed alike, in white uniforms, with a kind of red string tie around the collars of our shirts. I said that we were working in a diner now. Apparently the diner was just getting ready to open because there were no customers in there. I think the woman was with me but I think there were also people in there that weren't part of our group. One of the women who was working sat down at one of the booths and started looking at the menu. Each table had a menu laying on it. Customers started to come in. I walked over to the door at one point and pushed it open - the door opened out. I welcomed them and told them to have a seat, that someone would be right with them. It seems like it was dark outside now. The surroundings seem to have changed again but I don't know how or to exactly what. I was looking around and decided to look outside. When I went to look outside the door closed behind me and I couldn't get back in. I realized that the time had changed again. I got a bit frantic to be separated from my group. I was running around the building trying to find a way in or a way to at least communicate with my group. I found this one little slot. It was a rectangle that was maybe 12 by 18 inches. It had a kind of door on it that opened up. When I opened it there was another, and another, and so on. I don't think I ever got to the last one. They were made of different styles and materials. One was almost like leather with a leather pull strap. I thought I would be able to open it and call inside to my group to let me in or to help me. I ran a little further and found the door that we had gone in originally. I was relieved but when I tried to go in I found the door was locked so I still couldn't get in. I turned around and there was a man standing in front of a car looking at me. I could tell I was in trouble. He had an evil grin on his face. He stood there for a minute and then he started walking toward me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-02-29),-0.23513085,-0.091472484,-0.09075996,0.073545426
800,"I'm at home in my bedroom. I realized that my bedroom windows were open. When I got up to close them I realized that they were open because someone had broken in. My first thought that it had happened earlier and it didn't even occur to me that someone might still be in the house. I thought they had come and gone before I got home. I closed the window on the right side of my bed, noticing that the blinds were damaged. I went to the other window and tried to close it but it wouldn't stay closed. It kept rising back up. I kept pushing it down thinking I could get it to stay closed. Then I noticed how damaged the blinds were. They were very damaged and I couldn't do anything with them. People would be able to see in. I wasn't dressed because I don't wear anything to bed. I was ducking behind the curtain while I was trying to do something with the window. I pulled the curtains across the window, together, but realized I couldn't get them to stay there either. They looked different than they do in waking life. I was pulling one all the way across the window thinking that maybe I could get it to say behind the bed. That didn't work. Then it started to rain, freezing rain. Then I decided to go get something to sit on top of the window pane, so if I pushed the window pane all the way down and sat something heavy on it, it would stay down. I thought of something that I could use and it was in Matthew's room. As I headed into Matthew's room I realized that the TV was on, that something must have messed with the power to cause the TV to come on by itself. Then I realized that the other TV's in the house were on. I was trying to find a light that I could turn on. I thought there was a table lamp on a high dresser. There was all kinds of stuff sitting in front of it. I was being very careful but I ended up turning on some kind of large toy instead of a lamp. Then I was reaching much lower to the other side of me and I accidentally turned on another toy. I went to his closet and found my Ti Ping (don't remember the name) balls that are used for relaxation. They were in their box so I took those thinking they would be heavy enough. I pulled the window down in my room again, sat them on the top, and the window went right back up because they weren't heavy enough. Then I thought about my weights. So I went and got all four of my weights. At first I sat the smaller ones toward the center. I realized that the right and left sides of the window were sloped so I wouldn't be able to get the larger weights to sit there. So I put the heavier weights on the center. That still wouldn't work. The window was still open and the freezing rain was still coming in. I messed with the blinds again and tried to twist the wand to close them. I thought maybe if I could do that I could get them to straighten out. The wand was turning very hard. I was having a very difficult time trying to turn it. Then I started messing with the curtains again trying to get them to close and stay closed. I thought maybe I could put a chair in front of the window against the curtains to hold them in place. I was trying to decide, I thought about calling emergency maintenance and telling them that my window was open. I hated to bother them in the middle of the night. But I thought with the freezing rain it should be okay to call them but I still didn't want to bother them so I didn't call. Then for some reason I decided to go downstairs. As I went downstairs I heard some noise. It was kind of a hissing sound. As I was walking around I noticed that a window was partially open. I realized that it must have been from whoever had broken in. I closed it and was looking around again. I don't know what I was doing again. Then I noticed that the patio door was open. I thought that was strange because I was almost sure that it hadn't been open a minute before. I closed it and then I heard a window open. Now I really got frightened. I headed towards the front door though I don't know why or what I was going to do. Then I saw someone in the kitchen. I grabbed a very thin rope. I started yelling, Go away. Go away. Then Tim U came out of the kitchen. I didn't know what to think at first because it was Tim U, who used to be a maintenance man in my community. Before I could say anything or ask him what he was doing there he held up something that looked kind of jumper cables. I could tell that he was the one who had broken in and that he was there to rape me. He was saying in a very high-pitched sarcastic voice, don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. He intended to tie me up with these jumper cables and then rape me. Somehow I realized that he had done this to other women and that when things went wrong he either hurt them very badly - physically, or maybe even killed them. I was looking at him very intently. I was thinking that as soon as this is over and he is gone I'm going to report it and I'll be able to tell them exactly who did it. I was thinking about what I could have done differently. If I would keep my car keys on the front table maybe I could have grabbed them and gotten out the front door and gotten away. Where would I go? I thought I could have gone to a gas station but he might have followed me and could grab me outside the station. I wouldn't want to go in the station and put the employee(s) there in danger. I wouldn't want to drive all the way to my parents house, though I don't think he would have followed me that far. I realized that I don't know where a police station is in the city where I live. That alone scared me. Then I thought I could go to a fire station. But where is the closest fire station? I know where some of them are but I don't know which one is closest. But I could pull up to a fire station and blow my horn. There would be fire fighters there 24/7 so they would hear my horn and come out to help me. Now I started thinking about what I needed to do. I decided that I need to go to the office and found out where Tim Uis now because I know he doesn't work here anymore. I knew that I had seen him enough that I could give the police a good description and I could tell them definitely who it was.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-02-29),-0.05394821,-0.2488194,0.17350046,0.11836071
802,I seem to be at PLU though it doesn't look like PLU does in waking life. I am with Matthew and Chris H. There is a row of swings. We are all talking and swinging. I am playing around and I find that as I swing I am able to make the whole frame of the swing jump forward or backward. I can make it jump forward a couple of steps. The swings are very close to where the football team is practicing. I don't know if I am still on the swing or something related to the football team teasing. One time when I do it I realize that I've maybe gone to far or gotten too close. I turn around and start to run away. They decide to run after me and tackle me. A bunch of them do and they land on top of me. There is something about being in one of the buildings and something flying around in the building. A bug or a bird maybe but it's too big to be a bug and I'm pretty sure that it's not a bird. There's also something about me working on a computer document. There is a whole list of categories or maybe a list of titles or groups of words. I'm going in and looking at changing groups of words and I'm going in and changing the description of that title or group of words.,elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-01),-0.12279687,-0.08947569,0.039181948,0.11395036
807,"I can't decide if what I was doing was for school or for pleasure. I was in an historic home. I was there with other people that I knew. Supposedly the house was haunted by a former female owner of the house. During the visit we all went into one room for a kind of class. We had to go which makes me think it was for school. There was something about women had died in this room before when some certain thing occurs. I was sitting in the room listening to the lecture. The woman giving the lecture was dressed in period clothing but I can't tell you what period it was. She was talking to us as though she was this woman who continues to haunt the home. I was sitting there thinking that every time I am in that room I get a really sore throat. I thought it was related to this ghost but I don't know why. As the lecture continued she was talking about her ability to create bubbles or something out of this tube of liquid. We all had clear glass tubes with blue liquid in them. The tube was actually six-sided. I was holding mine between my legs but I don't know why. I think it had something to do with my not wanting to influence it with my hands. As the lecturer was talking I was watching the liquid in my tube and I realized that I was the one that was. It was like she was trying to blow a bubble out of this liquid. That the liquid would rise to the edge of the tube and then form a bubble on the top outside of the tube. While she was trying to do whatever it was I was watching the liquid in my tube rise and still hoping that I wasn't the one she had chosen because that meant that I was the one that was going to die if this legend continued of women dying in this home at the hands of this ghost. As the liquid rose it started seeping out of the tube onto something on my leg that was round but it had grooves in it almost like flower petals or a starfish, kind of like spokes coming out from the center of the circle. The blue liquid would ooze out and was filling these indentations in this round circular thing. Then it didn't ooze out from there. Somehow the liquid stayed contained in the grooves of this circle even though there were no edges on it to prevent the liquid from seeping out. The woman who was presenting the lecture and posing as the ghost approached me. We were talking about this circle thing on my leg. She was touching it and was trying to assure me that I was not going to be the next one to die as a result of this. After the lecture was over we were in another part of the house and we were still discussing it. Again I noticed a sore throat. There were other people that we were talking to in the house.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-07),-0.058926605,-0.15047912,0.18853699,-0.16283204
811,"I was walking up to the inside of the front door of my home. I was walking very slow because I was kind of afraid to look out the peep hole for fear that whoever was out there might be able to see me inside. When I looked out I saw it was Darren. His face looked really big like when you see something in a convex mirror. I said, Darren? Is that you? He shook his head yes. I reached up and put the chain on the door before I opened it just in case it wasn't him. When I opened it I could tell it really was him. He had his wallet out and took out a $50 bill and handed it to me. I took it and told him to wait a minute. I closed the door so I could take the chain off and open the door all the way. He backed up and I stayed up and thanked him and asked him something else. I also told him that I had written the Dept of Revenue about the title to that car, explaining the situation to them. I got a response from them just telling me that there was no lean on the car that I just needed to send them the title and they would send me a corrected title back. I asked him to please mail the title to me. I also told him that I sent him an email and guessed that he had just not had a chance to read it yet. That's when I explained to him about the letters. He said he would also send me something else but I don't know what that was. While I was out there talking to him Matthew came to the top of the stairs and called me. He was very little, maybe only three years. He said, Mommy. Mommy. I said, Just a minute Matthew. As I tried to wrap up my conversation with Darren I was thinking that I needed to go in and see what was going on with Matthew. I was thinking that I needed to tell Darren that. When I did go in I remembered that Brian F had been here and had changed our steps. We had wanted steps going into the basement, which I don't have in waking life. So to do that he had to take the steps upstairs and replace them with steps downstairs. He replaced the stairs going up with a pull-down ladder that you use for attics. I realized that was why Matthew hadn't come down, because he didn't know how to come down now. I pulled the ladder down and was really scared about using it. It was a very long way down to the basement and it was pitch black dark. Even in the best conditions I would have been afraid of going up that ladder. There were no rails to hold on to. I got to the top and I realized that I had to step over to the floor where Matthew was. The ladder was kind of swinging now so it became extra dangerous and scary. I did manage to get over there. Then I started wondering how I would get Matthew down stairs. I couldn't carry him down that ladder and he certainly can't climb down himself. He was lying in bed right next to the opening. I had put something around his ankles and tied them to the bed so he wouldn't fall through the opening. He got up and stood by the front of the opening when he was calling me. Now he was asleep again. I lay down on my stomach and rested my head on his stomach. That woke him up. I was really panicking about how I was going to get Matthew downstairs. I am back on the first floor thinking how these steps are not going to work, that I'm not going to be able to get Matthew down. I need to call Brian F and see if he can come back and see if he can just make the steps narrower and just have steps going up and down so I could go up like I use to. When I went up the ladder there was very little room between the ladder and the roof. It looks more like an attic than the second floor.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-13),-0.27522492,-0.14155295,-0.13904984,0.18823174
813,"I went outside the apartment. It was night and had started to snow shortly before. The ground was already covered. I was thinking about going somewhere so I had gone out to clean off the car and see how bad it was to decide if I really wanted to drive in that weather. As I got close to my car, it was parked to the left of the sidewalk, one of my neighbors across the street and to the right yelled out to me. I didn't understand her so I started walking towards her saying sorry I didn't understand you. She said it again but I still don't know what she said. As I got close to her I asked her if she was going out in this weather. She said she was going, to a family member or something to see the____. I'm going to say eclipse but it wasn't eclipse because it was night. I looked up into the sky and said I don't know enough about astronomy to know where to look. She said something like you can't see it from everywhere that's why she was going to this other person's house. It was something like you would be able to look into the sky and be able to see something like I'm trying to figure out how to describe it. I can picture it in my mind because when I was looking in the sky for it I knew what I was looking for. I knew what it would look like. It would look like a partial eclipse with a partial arc of light in the night sky. It wouldn't be moving like an eclipse either because it would be in one place for most of the night.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-13),-0.15234163,-0.21210638,0.1983739,0.028921772

I was wearing a thong bikini, which of course I would never do in waking life, especially not at my current weight. The people that were with me had brought horses along. Oh. He wasn't on horseback. When we found him the people that were with me gave he and I both a horse to ride home. They didn't have saddles so we had to ride bareback. Mine was a beige color horse. I climbed on and was having a bit of trouble getting situated because it was very uncomfortable since there wasn't a saddle and I was wearing a thong. The horses did all have a bridle and harness so we could hold on to the reins. We started down the river and I was surprised at how comfortable I was riding this horse and that I wasn't having any trouble at all. The horse seemed to naturally follow the other horses.

816,"I had met some women. I don't remember. I think we talked about CAS. I had intended to contact a couple of our female clients who with a couple of other professional women who were prospects for our training. I had intended to contact one of them named Colleen [unknown in waking life] , at a future time. They both worked for the same company. I was back at the office and there were various things going on in our training room. It looked more like a conference room. It had two large oval tables that sat perpendicular to each other but one end of each was next to the other. These women showed up, all five of them, and wanted to talk with me - actually Colleen just started talking immediately about why she was there. I asked her if she could hold on for just a second. I wanted to go see if we could go in the training room and sit down and talk. I headed in there because I knew Bill C was in there working. I wanted to see if he would mind going into another room so I could take these women in there to talk. As I went in to ask him the women all just followed me instead of waiting for me as I had asked. They just went in and sat down. I could tell Bill C was kind of upset. There was also a sofa sitting along one of the walls of this room. I went ahead and sat down and started talking with them. I don't remember, but I may have asked Bill C if he wanted to join us. I went ahead and sat down and started talking with them. Bill C sat on the sofa in a fetal position. He was wearing a hairpiece, that was fairly long - not below the ears, messy, black. There was something going on with him. I suspected that he had been drinking. I looked at him and said, Bill C, you really don't need to be here. If you have someplace else you need to be that's fine. He mumbled something, got up and left. I was relieved that he did. My meeting went very well. We ended the meeting with the agreement that I would do a proposal and take it to Colleen. I am back at the office and Bill C is back but he is now with several other people. It appears that he is either sober now or trying to sober up and one of the people in particular that he is with at the office is the person he calls whenever he starts drinking again. I went in the room with him once and someone was either saying something directly to me about not being there or I felt like I shouldn't be there or maybe someone was just suggesting that I not be there. I went in and started talking to Bill C and that actually made it feel that it was a good thing that I was there.

817,"It was 9 am and I was on my way someplace from home. I'm not sure where I was headed. I'm thinking maybe to the CAS office because it seems that Bruce U, from maintenance there, is with me. In fact, I let him drive. I was stopping by the apartment office so he just pulled up perpendicular to the guest parking spaces by the office rather than pulling into a parking space. He pulled across the end of two of them. He got out and I got into the driver's seat and pulled into a parking space. He jumps up. I apologized and said I was afraid I would be in the office too long and didn't want to be sitting out there in the street like that and blocking two parking spaces and such. He walked off but I don't know why or where he went. As I was walking into the office there was another black man walking alongside me. I don't know who he was or why he was there. I had a sense that he worked for the apartment community. Maybe he was one of the maintenance men there. I struck up a casual conversation with him, asking him how things were going and such. I went to the door of the apartment office and I realized that they weren't open yet but I was just going to wait. For some reason I wasn't realizing just how long I would have to wait. Pretty soon someone comes to the door and said since they were already there they would let me come inside and wait. I went inside. The office looked much different than in waking life. there was a long hallway directly in front of you. There were offices to either side. I was walking down this hallway trying to figure out where I should wait because there were nothing but offices with a couple of chairs by each desk. I get all the way to the back and there is someone back there - it's the woman that let me in. She looked at me quizzically. I told her I was trying to figure out where I should sit to wait. I don't remember her reply but she did ask me why I was there. I think I told her that I was there to pay the rent - whatever it was for I had a check to give to someone who was expecting it. She found something for me so she was giving that to me, telling me what it was. She decided to go ahead and take the check I had and take care of that for me. Because it was only going to take a few seconds. It turned out to take longer but she still went ahead and did it. She was making casual conversation, being very nice. She said something about this kind of thing occurring - like people asking them to let them in early or take care of things early. I told her that I try to be very careful about doing that because I know it can be an imposition. I know people take advantage when you are nice enough to do it once. I don't know that I actually said it to her but it was more like I was reminding myself that she did this for me and that I did not want to take advantage by asking her to do this for me in the future or expect her to do it for me in the future.

818,"Some of the family was at Brian F's. We had finished making his draperies. BJ and I were sitting at the kitchen table with Jason S. He started saying that he was there on Brian F's behalf about paying us. In waking life there was no agreement with Brian F to pay us. He didn't pay us. Jason S was going to try to renegotiate with us so Brian F wouldn't be paying us as much. BJ started to object and I stood up and, Jason S and I were sitting at opposite ends of the table and BJ was to my right, I leaned across the table. I leaned one hand on the table and with my right hand I was pointing a finger at Jason S. I didn't raise my voice but I was extremely stern in saying things like, Now just wait a minute here.

His face got really serious. I said, I told Brian F before we ever started this that those draperies would cost him $1500 a window if he were to buy them custom-made retail from WDF. I told him then that the only way I was going to help him make these is if he paid us $7.50 an hour. I was thinking in my head that he did not realize how many hours it would take even though I tried to warn him - and I did underestimate how many hours it would take. Brian F came out at that point and asked what was going on. At some point I could see that BJ was really upset and starting to cry because she was really counting on that money. To me it wasn't as much about the money as it was about Brian F keeping his word. I told Brian F what was going on. At this point Jason S had tears in his eyes too. I felt bad now and Brian F said that he had no intention of renegotiating. We had an agreement and that's what I intend to pay you. Now I am outside. BJ is outside. Jody S is there. I hugged Jody S, as it was the first time I saw her that day. As I was hugging her I told her that I upset Jason S. I didn't tell her that I made him cry. Somebody said something to Jody S about Jason S wanting to renegotiate our agreement with Brian F.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-24),-0.18388852,-0.017585242,-0.13449125,-0.048080936
819,"I was on my way someplace to give a presentation or workshop. I was driving a semi. I had gotten off at the exit ramp and stopped. There was a man standing in the exit ramping, actually pacing back and forth across the ramp. I got out of my truck and approached him. I don't think I actually talked to him. I think he was speaking with someone else. I went to figure out what was going on. As I did I realized that he was also driving a semi and his truck had broken down and was blocking the ramp so I couldn't go anywhere. I went and got back in my truck. Just as I did I saw him starting to pull his truck out of the way. There was enough of an opening that I could get by. I started to go through. As I did I realized that he was starting to roll backwards. I really burned it, giving it all the gas I could before he rolled into me. I was concerned and had it floored trying to get out of there but I wasn't panicked. I did make it. Now I am walking through a field and realize that there was another turn or something after I got off the ramp, that I missed to get to where I was going. I was walking through this field and there were a lot of people in this field working. One of the people in charge was a woman. I approached her and told her that I must have missed a turn. I told her where I wanted to go. She pointed and told me how to get there. I turned around and started walking back out of this field. There were a lot of people working there. They were all men except this one woman who was in charge with another man. As I'm walking out of the field, they are spraying things. I'm trying not to say anything or complain because it's my own fault that I'm there. But whatever it is that they're spraying it's hitting me a little bit and I'm trying not to be concerned about it. But I don't think it was just water so I was concerned. I also don't think it was a dangerous chemical. I was just concerned about it messing up my clothes or my hair, or how I was going to look when I got there to make the presentation. I walked into the place that was waiting for me. I tell them a little bit about what happened and that all of my stuff is in the truck and I had planned on getting cleaned up and getting ready when I got there. One of the things that was It was a couple of women that I was talking to. I don't know why but the topic of hair color came up and I had this little bitty thing, it was about the size of an ear plug, that was hair color. I also had one ear plug. One of the women suggested that this other woman could go ahead and help me color my hair since I had that with me. So she took me back to this other room and I had on my black shell top. She asked me if I needed to change and I said no, that I thought I would fine. I thought the way the top was cut it wouldn't be a problem. But I questioned to myself whether or not I really wanted to take that chance - of ruining my top.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-29),-0.2051482,-0.32079312,-0.11034348,0.30943343
820,"I was working at PUI. After work, around 4 or 5 pm, I left to go to a computer class on campus. I had not trouble finding the class. It was a short walk. There were a lot of people. It was a very large room. When I got ready to leave I grabbed my backpack and briefcase and left. I went out into another area of the building. It was a big common area divided into sub areas by furnishings and such. There were seating areas, refreshment areas and such. I was on my way to my car and reached for my purse to pull out my car keys. I realized that I didn't have my purse with me. I left it sitting in the computer classroom. Now I was confused and wasn't sure how to get back to the classroom. I stopped someone and asked but they weren't able to help me. At first I saw various people going into one area and sitting down to use computers and telephones. It was different ages and genders. I decided I would go ask one of the women. As I got close to them I realized that they were working for a company, making business calls. They were all working for the same company, doing the same thing. I changed my mind about asking one of them for help. I turned and walked away. I was near an elevator and now it was wall-to-wall people all of a sudden. I felt like I was getting run over. It seems that it was all men. I thought I let out a little scream, not very loud, but loud enough that someone could hear me. One man stopped and looked at me. There was another man, he and I just exchanged glances, but seemed like several seconds. Maybe we recognized each other. I finally asked another man if he could please tell me how to get out. I told him what had happened and that I needed to get back to the computer classroom to get my purse. He and another man I think. The one man decided to just go ahead and walk me there. He started practically running up these steps. I told him to wait a minute, that I couldn't go that fast and could not take the steps that fast. I started taking steps two at a time. Then I just quit taking the steps and kind of floated up the steps and caught up with him. When we got to the top of the steps he was extremely winded and muttering under his breath about taking the steps so fast and something else. Then all of a sudden he is gone. Now I am in an area that looks like the lobby of a movie theater. I went up to the counter to ask someone working behind the counter how to get to the classroom. There were a young man and a young woman working. The girl was going to call someone to get help for me. As we were standing there it was as though the building started shifting, it was like the walls and floor were motorized. The place where we were standing all started moving, fairly rapidly. I grabbed on to the counter because I didn't know what was going on. It seemed that the room did this in between movies, like when they were getting ready to let people in for a new movie. Now I was even more lost. I think it happened twice - but the second time I was at a different counter. Somewhere along here I realized that I had stuck my purse inside my briefcase so I did actually have my keys, because I saw my cell phone in there. Now I was just as lost, if not more. I still needed help finding my way to my car.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-30),-0.26827636,-0.059016313,0.24248385,-0.0721014
822,"Darren needed to tell someone, a woman, that I am still alive. He's really struggling with it. I think we're at the condo. He's struggling because he thinks he's going to have a really hard time with it. Maybe it's mother. It suddenly seems that it is mother that he has to tell. I sit down on the sofa with him. He is wearing the purple robe I made for him. He's been crying cause his eyes and nose are all red. I asked him why this is so difficult for him. I asked him if he is concerned about trying to explain why I let her and others believe that I was dead? I said, If it is, just tell them that at the time that I thought it was in Matthew's best interest.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-30),-0.14769165,-0.056386244,-0.38106218,0.09177041
823,"I was at PLU at the kid's apartment. I had some regular paint that they wanted to borrow. One room of their apartment they had painted the ceiling a bright yellow but they had also put stripes of other colors on it. There were going to do something else. I came back later and saw that they hadn't done it. I was in a car with Matthew. It almost seems that it was a police car. There was tons of traffic and he was cutting through the traffic. There were some people directing traffic, like at intersections. They signaled him on through because they thought he was coming through to help direct the traffic. Actually, I think I was dropping him off someplace. We had both gotten out of the car, and I tried to close my car door and didn't get it closed all the way. He came around and was going to close it for me. I couldn't get it closed tight and I couldn't get it back open. So he came over and got it closed all the way. As I left I decided I was hungry. I pulled into a McDonald's but when I pulled in, I pulled in right between the tables. It was like they were outdoor tables. I realized that it wasn't the place to pull in to get to the parking lot but I couldn't turn around, I couldn't go forward. I had to keep the switch the car back and forth between forward and reverse trying to maneuver myself straight so I could back out easily. I had pulled in because I was going to get breakfast. I saw these partially hidden hamburgers lying on two different tables. One was in front of me to my right and the other was behind me to the left. Neither of them were on buns or had anything else on them. They were each just a plain hamburger patty lying there, partially eaten. I think one of them belonged to Matthew so I was just going to grab it and finish eating it. When I finally got out of there I started driving down the street and thinking about doing a little clothing shopping because there seemed to be sidewalk sales everywhere. I thought maybe I could buy some clothes that were either a little tight or a size smaller than I've been wearing to help motivate me to keep working towards losing more weight.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-30),-0.27760747,-0.24266152,0.054569777,0.34794256
824,"It looks like I'm at my birth home but it was___ Alan K was a doctor and he had left a message for me saying that he wanted to talk to me about something, I don't think it was medical at all. He wanted my help with something. I had gone there to pick up Matthew. He was a baby. I think 2 years old or less. He had a rash all over the front of his legs and arms. I was debating whether or not to go see if Doctor Pf could fit him in or to call, or just talk to Alan K since he was a doctor and right there. I called his office instead to see if he could take a look at it. As I called him he answered the phone. Since it was me he told me that he wanted to schedule that appointment to talk about the other thing. Then he asked me why I was calling. I told him it was because of Matthew's rash and I was hoping he could look at it. He kind of passed it off like it was no big deal. I just said that I was concerned that it was measles or something because it was so bad. He finally came out and looked at it. By the time he looked at it there was almost nothing there. I said that was really odd because it was much worse than that just a couple of minutes ago. I wondered if it was an allergic reaction to something I was wearing, because when I was holding him and he was close to me it got really bad. Before that there was also something going on with me and I was thinking that if I called Doctor Pf he could just see the both of us. Whatever it was that was going on with me I didn't want to talk to Alan K about.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-30),-0.27595463,-0.055264447,-0.41375276,0.08799646
831,"I went to Tara S's graduation party. I stopped on my way home from St. Joe. Matthew didn't go with me. It was very awkward. They were having the party in their backyard. Some people were arriving and going to the backyard through the house. I just walked around the side of the house to the backyard. As I got around to the backyard I just stood there for a few minutes just observing. I'm not sure why. Some people were singing happy birthday and laughing because it wasn't a birthday party. Tony S and Dorothy S finally noticed me and came over and said hello and gave me a hug. They acted as though it had not been that long since we had seen each other. Dorothy S sat down and started talking with me. She didn't look pregnant but I got the impression that she was pregnant again. Later she had the baby and the baby was about a year old. Later I am back at the party and other members of my family are there. I had walked up and I think I was going to sit with them. It was now about 10:30 p.m. and I said I needed to go because I'm not used to staying up that late. I heard someone playing music and I asked if that was Tina S and they said yes. Someone said that Tara S had played one instrument and Toni S had played very simple instruments and Tina S had played something that took a lot more to learn. It might have been a clarinet. She was very good. I didn't actually see any of the three girls. They said they were so proud of Tina S's paintings, her artwork. They said something about the one in the entry way was one of hers. I had seen it earlier and I went back in to look at it again. They had it framed. It was fairly large. It reminded me of a page out of a coloring book that had been colored but I'm sure she did it freehand, not colored in someone else's drawing. When I got ready to leave Dorothy S suggested we get together for lunch. I said sure and told her to give me a call. As I was leaving it was now winter and there was snow on the ground. I had a shovel. I think I was going to clear a path. I noticed that there was a car behind me. I moved out of the way and the car just sat there. I waved at him to go on and he seemed to mouth the words, Aren't you going to clear it? I laughed and said no. I could tell by the look on his face that he was very irritated. He backed up and then went forward. Dorothy S came out and I told her what happened and that I couldn't believe he thought I was going to clear the whole road or driveway for him. Then she told me to call some government department and she told me what I should tell them. It was something very odd that I had not heard before. I went ahead and cleared whatever it was that I had intended to clear. It only took me a couple of minutes. I don't like to use the phone and I really don't like to use a cell phone while I'm driving. So I didn't have any intention of making the phone call that Dorothy S had suggested. Whatever it was she said would get this road on their list for the future - so they would clear it better or faster.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-04-25),-0.22194736,-0.21646973,0.05535982,-0.09745897
833,"I was back in high school and in some kind of sewing class. Peggy B from SDI was in this class as well. I think we had finished one semester and had returned to start the next semester. Peggy B was doing something different this semester that screwed up our schedule. The previous semester we had been paired up and worked on projects together in this one class. But this semester, whenever anyone was paired with her they didn't really have to do their part of the project. The project was sewing. The first week I was paired with Peggy B. She was making a duvet I believe. At the same time I was paired with a man that I remember from high school. His name was Tom A. I had gone to find him to tell him my idea that resulted from the situation with Peggy B. I found him in the library and he was sitting there with Mike Ke working on something. I went up to him and asked if I could interrupt. They were sitting at a library table across from each other. I just scrunched down.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-04-27),-0.26313496,-0.054743785,-0.14979513,-0.2161746
836,"I'm in my birth home. I am outside looking at the flowerbeds and maybe watering the flowers. I'm down in the basement and somehow I realize that the house is beginning to lean. I'm having a conversation with someone about this and we're talking about what if anything we need to do about it. With Daddy's health as it is we don't want to get him involved. We want to take care of it for him. I don't know if it is a period of time but it becomes worse. It's not like we feel it beginning to lean or anything but it does become worse so we end up calling someone. The man that we called or the man that comes out is a second choice because the man we wanted either wasn't available or we couldn't get in touch with him. The man that comes out to help is named Mel Gibson. I can't decide if it was just the same name as the actor or if it was actually the actor. He is doing something to I can't picture how this happens, I can only describe it. He does something to start pulling the house. I can picture him placing a tool somewhere high up against some walls. That is somehow supposed to. It almost reminds me of a vice and as he tightens it the walls are supposed to be straightening. At this point the walls of the second floor, at least in this area, it starts to collapse almost like it's falling to the side. It's not falling apart or collapsing like a house of cards. It's all moving. All the walls of the second floor are falling to one side to the point that no one can even stand on the second floor anymore. I think someone is trapped there. Not hurt though. I slither up the floor in one room on my stomach to grab something I'm afraid of losing or getting crushed or lost. As I get back out he is able to get the walls back upright and then this other person gets out as well. It's odd that it hasn't done any damage that needs to be repaired. It just pulls it back upright. There is still more to done. I mean it isn't exactly how it should be yet. There is some discussion that while we're doing this we're going to need something on the outside of the house to keep this in place, like a dump truck. We need to have someone bring a dump truck full of dirt to pour some dirt into the open area that is left by this wall straightening back up. I tell someone that we should go ahead and call them and have them come and be filling that in as he is straightening the house. I thought that would be smarter to do it at the same time. That way when the house is straight it will also be stable.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-04-30),-0.22963925,-0.04878481,-0.28486064,0.08152788
837,"I went up to church to participate in some kind of exercise session with my CRHP sisters. There was also something about being in the parking lot and I was trying to decide where to park. When I got there, there were a ton of people around. I went into a very large room, unlike in my waking life church. It had rows of chairs in it. The chairs were similar to those in our waking life chapel. Everyone was congregating in there. I wasn't sure if I was in the right place. I saw Helen J so I approached her and we talked a little bit. We were going to go find a place to sit down. I decided I needed to go to the bathroom but I didn't know if we were getting ready to start or what was going on. She told me that I should go ahead and go and she would hold the stuff I had with me - some papers and 2 or 3 pens. I gave her the booklets and papers but I was going to stick the pens in my pocket. Then it looked like we were going to have a prayer service or a Mass before the exercise session so I decided to wait. She told me again to go ahead now. I went ahead and I had to cross over a center aisle that they had created with these rows of chairs. I crossed the aisle as soon as Father and the servers had gone up to start Mass. When I got to the side aisle it seemed that the grade school children had come in for Mass. They had come in from the other direction so I waited until they all got by. There was a wall full of windows. In the hallway on the other side of that wall there were a lot of grade school children standing there - the older children. Some were standing right by the windows and some were standing back a little way. I worked my way between them to get to the women room. At the time I was thinking that I was glad that I wasn't a teacher that I wouldn't do very well with all of these small children. I was having trouble finding the women room but I don't know why because I knew where it was. When I got to the end of the hallway to my right there was what looked like a gym area but it didn't have the typical wood floor. I was having trouble seeing a partition between where this gym area and the Mass was. There were people there. There were young men playing basketball there. I was wondering if that wasn't going to disturb the Mass. But I could tell they were very conscious of this and trying not to be disruptive. I saw lots of doors that were entrances to mens rooms and maybe even a locker room. Now I'm driving and I'm going to drop something off someplace that the church had asked about or asking for donations for. I was going to drop those off. I was driving through Osborn I think. I didn't get directions because I knew I had been to the place before that I was going to drop these things off. I didn't think I would have trouble finding it. As I was driving through Osborn I suddenly realized that they had several inches of snow, maybe 5 or 6. The roads were kind of bad. I saw the place I was looking for just as I passed it. I thought to myself that I had done the same thing the last time. I was going to find a driveway to turn around in but I wanted to find one that was very wide so I would have to pull in but could just use it to do more of a U-turn. I finally found one and it did that. I went back to the place that I needed to be to drop off whatever it was that I was donating. I went inside and there were a few people there. I was talking to them and they were showing me something. There was some kind of material that they were going to be mailing out and showing me the pocket folders that they were going in. I said, Oh, you're going to be using pocket folders. She looked at me like she was annoyed. I said I was sorry - that I misunderstood. I didn't think they were going to be using pocket folders. Then I asked her if the pocket folders belonged to the church. She didn't know so she pulled one out and showed it to me. I said that they didn't belong to the church. The reason was that I was concerned about the expense and I didn't think they needed to be using pocket folders. If they were going to be using these that belonged to the church then it didn't matter to me anymore. This is contradictory but that's the way it was recorded. I thought it looked nice but I still didn't think they needed to be using pocket folders. Then I was standing by this table and there were something like looked like three-ring binders laying there for different things. Then the pocket folders that she showed me then. One side had stair-stepped literature and the other one had several different pieces of literature in it that were all the same size. This was a different one than she showed me because the things they were putting in them were the same size as the pocket and I thought that those would get lost behind the pocket which is why I didn't see why they were using them. This other pocket folder she showed me with the literature in it, on each stairstep piece you could see someone's picture. The other pocket had several 8 1/2 x 11 pieces in that pocket. At the table where the 3-ring binder were each binder represented a different time that this event had taken place. Each binder was a different generation of whatever it was that they were doing. I started talking to someone about the weather because I was wearing a very summery dress. I was wearing a dress that I owned around 1989. It had a light blue background with bright colored geometric shapes in it-pink, deeper blue, purple. I remember the approximate year because of where I was working at the time. I loved that dress. It was one of my favorites at the time. It had short sleeves and it was made out of a silky material. The skirt had a bit of a trumpet shape so it was very flowing, flattering and girly. I was saying that I was so surprised by this snow. Here I was wearing this very summery dress and I didn't even have a jacket on. Someone said something to me. I said I was on my way to meet my sister and maybe some of my other family. I said I was going to call my sister and try to catch her before she leaves and see if she can bring along a sweater or jacket. I was talking about BJ.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-05-02),-0.23382616,-0.14512067,0.20402917,-0.22621514
