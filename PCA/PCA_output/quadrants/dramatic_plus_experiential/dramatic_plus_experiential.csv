While talking to her on the phone, I could see her -- like on TV when two people talk on the phone and the black line on the screen separates them. The conversation was regular, just ""Hi"" and ""How are you?"" Nothing major. However, this is a sharp contrast to the experience I had when I actually called her last summer. She was hard to hear, like another phone in her house was off the hook, and there was a lot of background noise. The conversation didn't go well, as if she didn't know me.",college-m.tsv,,0.072684325,0.08148099

I didn't know until I happened to walk past the now-empty store and noticed that it was like a busy Saturday. I went in and found some of my old employee friends working, and they greeted me the way they usually do. Also, everything was switched around, with clothing racks facing different ways and what have you. I went home and told my mother. I said something like, ""Well, I guess I'd better apply again."" For some reason, my mother did not seem too enthusiastic about the situation. This is surprising, because she loved that store and the fact that I was working there.

The workers explained to me that they died that way, instantly frozen, when a deep freeze set in. I recall that I thought it was very odd that they didn't die slowly and why they weren't down on the ground. Then my brother came up to me and said that he saw my old car (which I owned 10 years ago and sold) fully intact, for sale in the yard. Then that's when I started seeing old cars in the junkyard surrounded by the dinosaurs. I started looking for the car and finally found it sitting on top of other cars. I looked at it and saw it was like my old car until I looked inside of it and noticed it was different than mine, then when I looked at the outside again, it was completely different.",college-m.tsv,,0.116925225,0.030931743

I noticed a nest on the left side and a bee's nest on the right. I went to get a closer look and a big black bird was sitting in the middle of the chimney. I had to back off because he got mad.

This ATM ran out of paper to record the transaction of ""fast cash."" I was eager to know how much I had left in my account. But because the ATM ran out of paper, I couldn't tell. I made purchases with my Baybank Mastercard that allowed the store to bill my account. I was a bit nervous maybe there was not enough money in my account, I thought. I wasn't sure whether the bank paid the store or not. So this confusion led me to dream about the ATM giving me a receipt of my transaction, which would have displayed my balance.

I can't remember why it didn't make sense. The next thing is we're standing in a living room. He's signing autographs and giving me all the baseballs that he signed.

We were all in our own vehicles. We were disagreeing on what highway to take. We were all in the air looking down at the different highways branching off from where we were. As I started on my way, the surroundings suddenly changed. I was no longer in a vehicle and no longer on a highway. The best way I can describe this is a car wash for people.

The emerald green carpet of grass highlights a sea of Mother Nature's finest floral jewels. What could possibly improve upon such a perfect day? Before I finish the thought in my head, I hear the whirring of the garage door, as it lifts to allow entry. I walk out to meet him. Such a paradox! It seems both like minutes and like years since I've seen him last. And still the butterflies flitter, a familiar sign of new romance, and I know I must stop them. This is an unattainable romance. Or is it? He enters the room and we sit side-by-side, sharing a glass of wine. He is charming, engaging, and intellectual. I found the conversation both stimulating and titillating. He is everything I remember him to be. How can that be? This is the first time I've actually met him and engaged with him. Yet it feels as though I've known him forever. As our conversation continues I notice the familiar, initial, light touches on the arm and hand. The touches of a budding romance? As we both express our enjoyment of the evening, we part company. My mind begins to work on this mental puzzle. Had we really not engaged before now? Is this how it feels to meet a soulmate? The conversation was so easy. I totally forgot myself as my desire to know everything about this intriguing man grew stronger. What a wonderful feeling, to be so focused on another. Thump! Confusion. Reality. , where have you been? What do you think you're doing? Where do you think you're going? Can you not see all of the roadblocks? Love conquers all you say? That kind of talk is for romantic fools. But, the chemistry! The spark! The fire! The beauty! The feeling of finally being at home! Is it simply a romantic fantasy? Maybe more people should look at the possibilities instead of the impossibilities. Perhaps that would give me the long yearned for love.

I was still working on my Ph.D. Someone was saying something about the medical degree having more prestige or being more valuable than the Ph.D. I stated my usual case that I agree that the medical degree is indeed very valuable to society. We certainly need good doctors and good doctors perform a great service to society. However, they also get paid very well for it and it does not require the same mental capabilities as a Ph.D. People who study for a Ph.D. are not easily recognized for their value to society, though a good Ph.D. brings great value. And they do it knowing they will likely never receive the same financial rewards as a medical doctor nor be given the same respect. In addition, the Ph.D. is by far a more difficult degree to earn mentally because it does not require the memorization of known information or already identified knowledge but instead requires the discovery of new knowledge. A M.D. can get their degree by getting certain grades and fulfilling certain tasks such as residency. A Ph.D., on the other hand, can get stellar grades, complete all requirements and still not receive their Ph.D. if a panel of judges does not approve the final dissertation work based on the dissertation defense - the final step of the Ph.D. process.

821,"I was living in the condo, except that it looked different than in waking life. There is something about a haircut and having two different people to choose from. I see a computer drop down list with each name mentioned. Both of these are people that I've had cut my hair before in a dream - I don't know them in waking life. I had narrowed it down to these two people that I allowed to cut my hair, depending on which one was available.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-30),0.24204622,0.033922654

834,Something to do with exercise. I can see a chart of numbers and there is something about the percentages of each of these numbers. When I walk I try to maintain 55 - 65% of target heart rate. It was something like that.,elizabeth.tsv,(2004-04-28),0.16200076,0.279792
835,"I had gone to a shopping mall. As I was driving through the parking lot I noticed how far away from the building some of the cars were parked. Then I realized that they belonged to employees. It was late in the afternoon. I was thinking that was a long way for employees to walk in the dark to get to their cars after the stores close. It was either kind or brave or both for them to park that far away so customers could park closer to the building. I wondered if the mall had a shuttle service to shuttle employees to their cars at night, to keep them safe. Then I remembered that a long time ago when I worked at the mall they didn't have such a service. I also didn't remember parking that far away or having to walk that far at night, which is when I usually worked.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-04-28),0.05621903,0.17812623
838,Last night before I went to sleep I was watching a TV program about the final episode of Friends. This dream was kind of an extension of that special where they were continuing to interview the actors and writers from the program. In particular they were talking about how some or all of the actors may reunite on the spin-off program. One thing in particular that I remember is that they should all reunite at Thanksgiving because on the program the six of them always spent the holiday together.,elizabeth.tsv,(2004-05-05),0.2634241,0.22019406
840,"Something about the weather and involved a computer printout of something related. It was very hot, Matthew was home for a visit. I had all the windows open because I didn't want to turn the air conditioning on but I knew he probably preferred that I have it on. I was looking at this print out and thinking that the weather was going to change and/or the printout was wrong. I didn't think it was a big deal because I knew I could go to the computer and print out an updated or correct version.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-05-08),0.07777785,0.36770967
