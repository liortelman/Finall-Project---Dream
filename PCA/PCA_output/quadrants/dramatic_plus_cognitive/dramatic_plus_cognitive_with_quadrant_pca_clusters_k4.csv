While talking to her on the phone, I could see her -- like on TV when two people talk on the phone and the black line on the screen separates them. The conversation was regular, just ""Hi"" and ""How are you?"" Nothing major. However, this is a sharp contrast to the experience I had when I actually called her last summer. She was hard to hear, like another phone in her house was off the hook, and there was a lot of background noise. The conversation didn't go well, as if she didn't know me.",college-m.tsv,,0.088685386,-0.08820775,-0.028630875,0.08064736,2

I went in and found some of my old employee friends working, and they greeted me the way they usually do. Also, everything was switched around, with clothing racks facing different ways and what have you. I went home and told my mother. I said something like, ""Well, I guess I'd better apply again."" For some reason, my mother did not seem too enthusiastic about the situation. This is surprising, because she loved that store and the fact that I was working there.

24,"I was with someone in a store kind of like a Kmart. I don't know who I was with but they were shopping in a different part of the store. I was looking for plastic storage containers. I wanted to see how much they were or if they were on sale. When I got to the aisle where the storage containers were they were many sale signs hanging by them on the back wall of the shelving unit. I remember seeing one that made me think they were on sale for $5 and some cents. The signs were hanging next to the containers rather than in front of or over or under the containers, as would normally be the case in a store. There were actually no products for sale under or over the signs. I remember thinking this is a great price. The containers were clear, frosted kind of look, with blue lids. They were rather large, like 5 gallon size perhaps but rectangular. I decided to look more closely at the signs and realized that all of the sale signs were for personal care products that weren't even in that aisle. They were hanging in layers on top of each other but maybe four or five across also. I thought to myself, ah, the employee who was supposed to hang these probably didn't want to do it so hung them all here just to say the job was done. I went to find a manager to tell them about it. I found a young man, though I don't know if he was a manager or not, and told him about the signs. I walked back to the location with him. When we got there, an employee had just finished filling that spot with Tampons. I get a sense that he put the tampons there but I'm not sure. The tampons were piled so high that they hid the sale signs completely. The man I brought back to show them to somehow looked behind the tampons and saw the signs. As I walked away, he was using a hammer to loosen the shelf above the tampons/containers/signs. I thought that he was doing that so he could get to the signs to remove them. The next thing I remember is that I was still in the same store but I was looking at clothing. As I was looking, I encountered a woman acquaintance. I say acquaintance because I don't know who she was. I get the sense that she was someone that I was not particularly fond of. I chatted with her a bit; she was just standing around waiting for someone she was with who was shopping. I selected a few items and went to the dressing room to try them on. As I returned from the dressing room, I went by the men's dressing rooms. They were all full. While I could not see any of the men in the room, I got the sense that one man was completely naked and I could see pubic hair, nothing else. I felt embarrassed and tried to hurry by. Some men looked at me as though they thought I worked here. I remember thinking to myself that I have spent too much time working in retail, because my past work in retail affects my shopping experiences, related to things like the sale signs. Now these men think I work here. They were trying on sports coats. I commented to both of them that they looked great. They were both black men. The one seemed very happy that I told him he looked great. He said something to the other man as I walked away. I don't know what he said. I went back to where I got the clothes I had just tried on. The woman acquaintance was still there. She was kind of leaning on a circular rack full of clothing. I approached her again; I think to put the clothes back that I had just tried on. She was standing so close to the rack that she was somewhat in between the clothes on the rack. I started talking with her again. It seems that we were talking about a mutual acquaintance. I don't really remember, except that she made some comment about alcoholism and I asked her if she was an alcoholic. She said yes. I am now walking around the store pushing a shopping cart and at the same time trying to carry a large metal ladder. I can't remember why I had the ladder. It also seems to me that there was nothing in the shopping cart. I have been called to the manager's office. When I walk in there are two male management members and one female. I remember nothing about the female. The one male did all of the talking and the other male, who seemed to be his superior kept fidgeting in his chair and turning his back to me through the whole conversation. The male who did all of the talking was the actor who used to play Judge Harry Stone on night court. He began by saying they wanted to discuss a few things with me. They handed me a list and began to go over the list. The list was typed on rather dark, brown, very heavy stock paper. I wondered to myself why they had chosen this because you could hardly read what was typed on it. The first things they discussed were very general and did not appear odd to me. I was cordial and making light, comments to evoke smiles or chuckles as the conversation began. They said they had been watching me on camera that afternoon. I think that it was at this point that I determined that they were terminating my employment. I looked at Harry and said, you are accusing me of stealing aren't you. He said, you bet we are! I realized we all had the brown pages and they were in a binder with a rather large number of other pages though the others were all white. I told him I wanted him to put that in writing, on one of the white pages. He said gladly. He and I started flipping through the white pages. It was as though he wanted to pick a certain page to write it on. I didn't care; I just wanted it in writing. I was so very angry. I had stood up at this point and was talking very loudly and angrily at him while pointing to the book and asking him to put that in writing.",elizabeth.tsv,(1999-06-12),0.011648785,-0.34212193,-0.337459,0.033332493,0

Let me think. Then said, Noonagaboona. [Again, German, no idea how to spell.] I said wait a minute because I thought something else should be said first.

131,"It was the morning of October 21, 2000. I was at this large, old house. 2-3 people showed up for the first regional conference. They had not pre-registered but rather just showed up hoping to get in. I explained to them that the event had been cancelled and I think they left but I'm not sure. The next thing I know there are 50 or more people there for the same reason. Wanting to attend but not having pre-registered. I had them all take a seat at tables. The tables were all like dining tables and set up with dinnerware for a meal. I climbed halfway up this very wide staircase to speak to the people. I said, I am vertically challenged so I'm going to stand up here to help you hear me. They all chuckled. I announced that there had been a problem with the mailing and so we had cancelled the event. Since there were so many of them there, we were going to see what we could do to accommodate them. I explained that there was no way we could get Bart H there at this late notice, but I would see if we could get Barry C on an immediate flight. I also stated that my presentation would be different since I did not have the proper AV equipment. I was thinking that I would only tell them that much although I was worrying about it because I had not finished preparing that talk. I was also trying to figure out what we were going to do about food, etc. I didn't mention anything about vendors because I knew there was nothing that could be done about that. I noted that two of the people who had signed in were people who had worked with dreams and I think I knew them. I had asked one of them if he could make a presentation to fill in the space allotted for Bart H. Somehow the other one got the message that I had asked for him. I decided that was fine. Regarding the food, at first I thought I would have to just tell them they would be on their own for lunch. A little later, I thought I about doing something simple that could be done last minute like calling Subway to deliver. That way we could still do the lunchtime dream discussion groups. I told the people who were there that I would figure out an adjusted price due to the circumstances. I thought a little more about what would be involved to get Barry C here. I thought he would surely have some money in a savings account that he could pay his expenses just until he got there and then I could reimburse him. I would have to tell him not to call Continental just to use his $100 voucher but try to find the best airfare for the time he needed. I would also tell him to just take a cab when he gets here and I would reimburse him for that as well. He might have to take a cab from his home to the CHV airport as well. I think I woke up more than once in the middle of this dream [unless I was simply lucid] thinking I can't believe that this is a dream and the event was supposed to be yesterday. But I am working through this in such detail in a dream, knowing that it didn't or wouldn't happen.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-10-22),0.08384564,-0.13254672,-0.036026683,0.13906261,2

I found the DDSI meeting. I was sitting at a round table with 8-9 people. Jeannette T and Marcia N were there. I thought, oh, they do both still work for WDF. I recalled that I had thought about contacting Marcia N for a job before but now see that she is still happily working for WDF. I also noticed that they did not present themselves as they used to. They used to be very particular about their appearance regarding make-up, hair and clothing. At this meeting they appeared somewhat unkempt; no make-up and their hair kind of messy. Marlene F was there. I was surprised that she was there. I decided that she had perhaps bought a franchise in FWI. Later, at the meeting I think, they were doing something and talking about something in a treasure chest. Vince P and someone else wheeled in this very large gold square box that was supposed to be a treasure chest. Vince P was pulling it into the room by a rope. It was about 4 feet high and 4 feet square. Now it seemed as though I was sitting with Patti C and the treasure chest is small and sitting on the table in front of us. We are looking at the contents. It is all bags of candy. We realized that each kind of candy represented a different award so we were counting each kind of candy to determine how many of each award there was. The only kind I remember is Jelly Beans and that was the one there was the most of. One of the franchise owners was standing up talking to Vince P and Joanne N. I think they were recognizing what they had done for the franchise owners. She was pulling out these little toy figures, about two inches tall. They had been buried under the bags of candy. Each different figure under a separate kind of candy. When I realized this I tried to put the candy back exactly how I had found it. I went into the DDSI office and was looking for people I know, just to say hello. I realized that Joanne N was the only one there that I knew, but I decided to go ahead and say hello. I walked into this office building lobby and there were these three unusual people. I don't know how to describe them.

618,"Lee and the FD. My family owned the FD, the place that I worked when I was in high school. I had just arrived. Everyone else was there already and had started eating dinner. I think Aunt P and Aunt H were there as well. I went back to the kitchen to fix myself something. One of the freezer's was standing partially open, there was too much food in it and the door wouldn't close all the way. Some of the others were eating fried chicken that looked good so I decided to fix that for myself. There were two deep fryers, one above the other. The top one was used only for French Fries and there were French Fries in the basket and some just floating in the fryer. I noticed that because the only time fries should have been in the basket is if they were frying, and there shouldn't have been any floating loose in the fryer. The pieces of chicken were very small so I put two in the bottom fryer - one leg and one other piece. There wasn't very much oil in there so I couldn't completely submerse the chicken. I hoped they would cook completely anyway. I put the rest of the bag of chicken back in the freezer. When I did I realized that the only reason the door wouldn't close all the way earlier is because of the way some one had put this bag in there. It closed fine now. I saw that my chicken was cooking very slowly so I looked at the temperature controls and noticed that they were both turned way down. I tried to turn my up but wasn't being successful. I stuck my head out into the dining room and asked someone if they knew what I was doing wrong. Lee, my boyfriend only, came back to help. He looked like the young actor I've seen on TV on the show Crossing Jordan. The one interested in Jordan. He said he knew how to adjust it. There were two dials that you need to adjust. He took care of it for me, gave me a light kiss on the lips as he put his hand on my arm and then went back into the dining room. I don't know where we are but we have luggage with us. We were going somewhere but I don't know where. I know that my older brother and Lee were both with me. I think we are at an airport. When we arrived there Lee was going to go talk to someone or do something. He wanted to check with me first and make sure I didn't mind and that I would be okay. I said, sure. We kissed a couple of times, briefly. Again, as he put his hands on my arms. He told me I was the best. I was thinking that it was nice to be in a relationship with such complete mutual trust and affection. I was thinking how fortunate I was. Bob F and I were sitting at a table. I had some of my coins lying on the table in front of us. When I picked them up to put them in my wallet I realized that there were these other things there as well that looked kind of like coins, maybe more like mashed bottle caps but they were very shiny and gold and silver just like coins. They each said something on them though, in larger print than you would see on a coin. I started sorting them out from my coins to put them back on the table. Bob F said something about Bill F. I said, Yes. Bill F probably would like these. I was thinking about the fact that while I only pick up and save coins that I find on the street, Bill F picks up and saves anything even remotely looking like a coin - game tokens, etc. So I decided to keep these things and give them to Bill F. Bob F and I had taken our things and we were in a very large elevator, kind of like a freight elevator. There were other people in there as well. I noticed something about these people but now I can't recall what. They were doing something to delay us or something and I was trying not to be irritated or annoyed by it.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-21),0.0037282035,-0.06955078,-0.21021974,0.048524868,2
619,"The old music group The Monkees wanted to make a comeback. Someone was trying unsuccessfully to help them. I made some suggestions that fell on deaf ears. The band members had mixed emotions about the comeback. Micky Dolenz was the one that wanted it most. Peter Tork and Mike Nesmith were easily able to let it go. I don't remember hearing Davey Jones' feelings about it. Mickey wanted the comeback very badly and was very upset that it wasn't working out. I got a call from an agent or some such person in California. She wanted to come meet with them. Someone had suggested that she meet Mickey in BR near the train station. I called her and asked if she would be staying in town and she said that she would be returning to CA on the same day. I then suggested that they just meet at the airport. It would be easier for everyone and save her time. She said that was a good idea. She gave me her flight information, airline and flight number, and told me to have him meet her at baggage claim. After I finished speaking with her I realized that I did not get her flight number nor did I make arrangements for how they would find each other. Then I realized that she might know what Mickey looks like from past TV programs and albums. I called Mickey and shared the good news. I told him he could get online and look up her flight to see what time it arrives. Since she is leaving the same day I thought it was odd that she would want to meet at baggage claim. I have the sense that she was going to have baggage with her but I don't know why she would. I was at the airport and met her. I was sitting and chatting with her and employees from the airline came up and spoke with her. They obviously knew each other. I summized that she used to work for the airline. We went to sit in a different place in the airport, at a small round table. A gentleman came up to bring us something and he knew this woman also. They were old friends. He was tall, average build, brown hair but balding, and wore glasses. He had on a white shirt. He worked there, maybe at a restaurant at the airport. As we sat there we were watching this large crowd of people, mostly women, yelling and screaming. It turns out they were watching the Monkees perform. I said to this woman, see how much they love them? She nodded her head yes. I don't know if this was happening live or on TV. The woman's male friend came up to the table again and as he began to walk away she said, Oh. I'm sorry. Let me introduce you to my dear friend Mark. [unknown if this is someone I know in waking life.] He turned back around and shook my hand. I noticed he was wearing a wedding ring but had the impression that he was single. I don't know what gave me that impression. I was thinking what a nice man he was. A little later the woman and I were sitting and talking with him. He had something written across his forehead. It was probably five or six lines of text, very clearly readable, and an arrow with a red stem and blue tip. There was also a birthmark that looked a bit like an x. At first I thought the text and arrow were there for medical reasons and I felt sad for him that he had to live with that and how that must get people's attention and cause them to stare and such. It was impossible not to notice if you look at him but I tried not to look at it long enough to read what it said. I finally gave in though and read it. When I read it, it seemed to be there for fun, saying something about beer and I don't know what else. Then I thought it was just odd.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-25),0.037897833,-0.09570648,0.13688208,0.0013911308,3

The impression that I have right now is that I had a number of Excel spreadsheets that had lists of things that I can best describe as characteristics or issues. For example, if I were writing something I might want to make a bulleted list of factors, characteristics, issues, etc that apply to or help to describe what I am writing about. It was information that anyone could use - not necessarily related to business or profession. There were then also separate, singular words that I can't even decide if they were written down somewhere, if I was viewing them on the computer or if they were just in my mind. There were two separate sources of the lists and of the singular words respectively. I was seeing the mental connection between the two, how one word was a perfect fit for one list, another word a perfect fit for another list and so on. So, for example, the list associated with communication were things that would help people to understand more about communication and could help them become much more effective communicators. They definitely felt like insights that would be knew to most people - not written about before. The more connections I made the more excited I became. Also, it felt almost like one of those things that I classify as things that you don't know that you know - it's as though seeing it or hearing it brings it to the conscious mind.

I used the spreadsheet to work with internet urls and they had something to do with the TV program American Idol. I was working with producers and/or the host of the program. It seems that each url had a question associated with it and they were being used somehow with or by the participants in the competition. We were testing them. but not by clicking on the urls. We may have been asking some of the questions. And we were doing an overall evaluation of what we had so far. Was it too many? Were they the right ones? Were people able to use them and understand? Some involvement by or with the competitors helped us to see that there were too many and that some were not clear. So we began editing and deciding which ones to eliminate and which ones needed to be changed for clarification. We began making changes to some of the questions and eliminating some of them. At this point I think maybe at least one of the judges, Simon, became involved. There was discussion about a favorite charity of each of the judges. Simon had started a charity called Hard Hats for Kids. I thought it was such a great name. It fit the charity so well. It was metaphorical but I can't remember what it was a metaphor for.

Maybe 10 or more were employees and the others were clients that were there for a meeting. I think the WI Company was there for a meeting. I passed Steve W and we both nodded and mouthed the word hello. As we did I realized that it was him but didn't say anymore, even though I hadn't met him before. There was a lot of activity. just like you would see right before any kind of event, when people are getting ready to take their seats and chatting with each other and such. Susan J worked there. Something had happened with her boyfriend that she was upset about. It seems that maybe he was serving in the armed forces and was detained from coming home when he was supposed to. There was some connection between this and red and purple roses. Susan J had made a bunch of red and purple roses out of tissue paper. They were about 6 inches in diameter. She came out of her room once and she was wearing some kind of outfit, or costume, that she had made. She had covered it with these roses. Then she went back into her room. Some of us were talking about what we could do to help her, as she was clearly very upset about her boyfriend. We had tried something, as a group, to cheer her up or provide some comfort but it didn't work. The boss hadn't wanted anything to do with it. I don't think he wanted to be bothered and I think that he also did not want any of the rest of us spending our time this way. So then someone made a bunch more of these tissue-paper roses and planned something else to try to comfort or cheer her. Myself and another woman went to her room. We knocked on the door but without waiting for an answer opened the door just a bit. I stuck my head in to look for her as I called her name. As I was doing this, though, I realized that it was inappropriate for me to open the door without waiting for her to answer. As I put my head in the door it was pretty dark in there. It was a bedroom and I saw her lying in bed. She had been lying on her right side, with her back to the door. As I called her name again, she heard me and leaned up on her right elbow and turned her head over her right shoulder towards the door. I asked her to come out for a minute. that we needed her for something. When she came out six people were wearing the rose outfits/ costumes. They were standing in a row.

Maybe because I thought they were too similar. Later I realized that they had quadruplets, not twins. I had a picture of them with the four babies. I was running around showing the picture to members of my family and saying over and over, Tony S and Dorothy S had four babies. I immediately thought that I really needed to go see them now.

1505,"Matthew was out for awhile so I decided to fix lunch. I was going to deep-fry something, which I would never do in waking life. As I was waiting for the oil to heat I saw a plate of mini egg rolls sitting on the counter and decided to reheat them by putting them in the oil as well. I had a very large soup pan and only had a few inches of oil in it. As the things I put in started cooking I was doing some other things in the kitchen and suddenly noticed oil spilling out of the pan onto the stove and the counter top. I just kept working and then noticed the oil getting very near the edge of the countertop. I quickly grabbed a few paper towels and placed them at the edge to prevent the oil from going on to the floor. Then I noticed that some had already dripped onto the floor. I took my paper towel and began trying to wipe up the oil wherever I saw it. I noticed that the burner drip tray was completely full of oil. I looked into the pan and saw that there was almost no oil left in it. I turned off the burner. Using a strainer spoon, I lifted the food out of the pan in a little at a time and placed it all on a plate that had a paper towel on it, so the some of the oil would soak into the paper towel. Sometime during this Matthew came home and had some leftovers with him from the meal he had while he was out. It was also something fried, but there were little bits of whatever it was. I put it in the oil with my things to reheat it as well. I had just finished taking the things off the stove when some of my family showed up. We all sat down in the living room. After a little while I realized that they were planning to stay for a little while but I knew I needed to eat so I brought the plate of things I had taken off the stove, popped one in my mouth and brought the rest to the living room to share. I sat the plate on an ottoman and told everyone to help themselves. BJ is the only person that took one. I continued to eat as we talked. I told Matthew that I had a new project I wanted him to help me with. I told him that I wanted to make the screened porch usable and especially, to put my chaise lounge that sits on the patio in the summer out there so I have a place that I can sit and read. It appeared that he didn't really see what I was going for, or didn't think it would work. I said that I realized I wouldn't be able to use the room when it is raining, but I could use it any other time. I also said I don't know why I haven't done anything with it before now. I've thought about it before and even talked about it before. In the dream I was trying to remember which of my waking life homes had this screened in porch. I thought about the house on Lakeland Dr., but immediately remembered that we had built a deck on the back of that house that ran 2/3rd of the length of the house. I then remembered, still in the dream, that I had dreamt about this same screened porch before, not that it had been on any of my homes. It is certainly something I would love to have on a home. The porch runs the full length of my home in the dream, which is a long ranch home. It isn't very wide. We all walk out there to talk about what I want to do with it. As soon as we enter the porch we see lots of things sitting here and there. There is a bicycle, a single chair facing a small cabinet housing a Nintendo video game. As I look at the various things I look at Matthew and ask if he remembered it was out there and if it was something he still wanted. Some of the things I was disappointed in myself that I had forgotten that they were there. Someone said they noticed three pair of boots sitting just inside the door that leads to the yard. They said that was a sign that this room was obviously used some times. I'm sitting on a small outdoor bench facing the other part of the house. Bill F. is sitting to my right. I mention some item that was back there and asked him if he wanted it and he shook his head no. I mentioned something else and asked if he wanted that and he shook his head no again. Then, I asked him if he wanted to play the video game and he shook his head yes as he stood up to walk over to it. Then BJ came up and was crouched down near the floor and showed me a sketch she did for what she thought I should do in the room. Her drawing showed various pieces of dark wood furniture and the primary color in the room was a deep red. As she was explaining her suggestions to me I was just thinking that it was nice and I agreed with her, but that would all take money and I'm still unemployed.",elizabeth.tsv,(2007-01-05),0.013359409,-0.15334958,-0.11166654,0.052578274,0

Phoenix-H-8,"#Phoenix-H-8 (04/??/64) This dream took place in the Seaside Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where I was working as a waiter. There was also in the dream a playhouse attached to the hotel. For some reason they were having a play and one of the cast was not able to participate, and I somehow took his place. The play that was being presented was Hamlet, and I was to play Hamlet's brother. That night that the play took place, only the first act was presented and the next two acts were to be presented the next night. I didn't remember the actual play at all. I do remember immediately after the play. Two of the young owners of the hotel, Barbara and Bernie, came back stage and were congratulating everyone, and they especially looked to me and said something to the extent that, ""You did a great job. We're very proud of you,"" or something like that. At this the star of the play turned to me with a very jealous and enraged look on his face, but at this moment the curtain went up for another bow. The audience was cheering quite loudly, and myself and the star took our bows. Then we presumed that that was the last curtain call, and I started to look around for my jacket. It was a green jacket. I couldn't seem to find it. I also remember seeing the audience very clearly as a large group of people. I was looking for my jacket and finally I suppose it was about five minutes later and the theater had pretty much cleared out, and I opened the curtains thinking it might have been left in the orchestra pit or something, and there was a small row of boys left still cheering for some reason. Must have been about 12 of them all sitting very closely together, and there in the orchestra pit I did find my jacket lying on top of the piano. While I was taking one of my curtain calls, a woman in the audience spoke up and asked me if I was a graduate student or an actor, and I said I was only an actor as a hobby. I took this as a rather flattering question. In the beginning of this dream there was something else that preceded this, but in trying to remember the dream while I was still apparently in a sleep-like state, I was trying to recount the events of the dream and just before I started them, I dreamt that Dr. Hall came into my room and said something to the effect that, ""Roger, I hear you have a dream."" I said, ""Yes, I'm trying to remember it now,"" or something like that, and he somewhat indicated to me that he knew some of the contents of the dream, that he had them typed out on a card, and this rather amazed me because at this point I felt if this was so, then he must have sent them to me by ESP. Having recovered from my amazement, I said, ""Well, I'm going to have to try to recall the dream now to get it nice and clear,"" and I went on to recall the dream, but 10 minutes later I woke up, fully awoke, so apparently this episode was either part of re-dreaming the dream a second time in an attempt to recall it or possibly it was just an additional part of the dream. It's very hard to say. Many of the events that I have described are real life settings such as my having been a waiter at the Seaside Hotel in Atlantic City. In fact, there was a playhouse, not attached to it, but right next to it. It belonged to another hotel and a friend of mine was in a play there, but none of this is really day residue although it all comes from memories of the past.",miami-home.tsv,(04/??/64),0.043924566,-0.00828895,0.084713645,-0.14640002,3
Sam-H-7,"#Sam-H-7 (03/14/64) (Observation) The scene was inside a gymnasium and there were a bunch of basketball players sitting along the wall on a bench, and the coach went up and told one of the basketball players that he was fired.

Except when he fought, the player couldn't hurt the coach. Coach laughed and said, ""If that's the best you can do, you'd better leave."" The coach had told him to go to 42nd St. and 42nd St. (which I realized didn't exist). This precipitated the fight also. And he left and went to a drug store and the stools were full at the counter, so he just kind of walked through. Then he was walking down the street, having gone through the back door. The street numbers were real screwy -- driving one block the numbers would change 100 (for instance, from 49 to 160 in one block). I didn't see him anymore. (Participation) We were down on a dock and he came walking there, and his face was all bloody. I asked him why and he said he wrecked his car, and I knew he didn't have a car, so he must have stolen one (didn't observe this aloud). Asked if no one else was hurt. Said no. Then we got on a little boat with a captain. Funny way of getting on boat -- had 2 perpendicular rails to ground in doorway of boat. They got closer to door frame. You had to wedge your feet on either side, hold on with your hands, disengage foot and step through. Boat ride costs $40. We were on these little things like surfboards, lying down and going down a waterway with little waves a few inches high. Captain said, ""Make sure you keep the tip end of board over little ridge of water or else you'll sink."" Went further -- then said reason for using these shallow boards is there is a sunken ship beneath us. If you put your arm down in water, you can feel it. I felt it -- covered with layer of soft touch muck. (No feelings about it.) First I felt he door on sunken boat, opened it and tried to reach down into, but couldn't feel anything. (Boards we're riding must have stopped.) Went a little further on rafts. Reached down and felt a soft bottom. When we got to shore, I went home. Mother-in-law wanted to know why I hadn't cleaned the yard, and I told her I spent all day yesterday cleaning it up and the kids had messed it up again. She said, ""That's impossible,"" and I said, ""Ask Diane (my wife)."" She said, ""Yes he did, but one of the kids was rolling through a pile of pine needles and had spread it all over the yard.""

""They do it that way at country churches."" And he said, ""Oh, I better sit in the balcony."" I said, ""It's the old Poplar Springs vs. Mount Gallagher thing."" I put another pack of saltine crackers in my knapsack along with a Webster's dictionary and a bruised banana. (I was) working a job proofreading and there was copy spread all over the table. Newsprint catalogs with long lists of job codes. The boss man said something to hurt Dora's feelings and I screamed out, ""Don't you ever do that again! I could hurt your feelings if I wanted to."" He said, ""Go ahead."" I said, ""There's no reason to hurt someone's feelings."" He said, ""Well I'll hurt yours. You're too quiet on the job."" I laughed and said, ""I'm proofreading. What do you expect with foreign languages?"" A girl, Thomlina, came by and asked me where the boss was and I said, ""What do I look like? A goddamn secretary?"" The boss had been temporarily hidden from view, but was clearly working at the heat press wearing a blue shirt. I tried to find something in my knapsack and while I was looking I scattered things inadvertently all over the floor. A guy said, ""You are too messy."" I said, ""It's my work station. It doesn't bother me. I do a good job. Just try to find a mistake."" But all the while I knew I'd fallen asleep on the job. I couldn't fit everything I'd taken out back into my knapsack so I started making selections on what to keep. The only thing that was really important was my father's black Webster's dictionary from college with the caveman writing. Under the flap of my address book where business cards were suppose to go I'd put rice cakes and a slab of peanut brittle. On the loudspeaker the pilot said, ""All those going direct flight from LA to NY back to LA non-stop."" I said, ""What's the point. You're just killing time. And anyway I was looking for the MetroNorth train."" He said, ""Try the ground."" I ran down the beach and there was a subway station in the sand. The red light was blinking and beeping. I ran. Other people were running. I knew if I missed the train I'd have to wait another hour (to meet Rudy). The sign said: <-- scenic tours Poughkipsee and I asked the token lady, ""Which way to NY?"" She said, ""Where in NY?"" I said, ""NY, NY."" She said, ""The city or the state? I said, ""Both."" She said, ""Not here."" I said, ""How do I get there?"" She said, ""Go wait by that yellow house. About halfway back and a few blocks over."" I said, ""Don't you know a street or anything?"" She said, ""It's the YELLOW house in the middle of the block."" I asked a guy if he knew a street name and he said, ""Try Dobbs Ferry.""

14,"Rudy had a computer made out of slabs of rocks.

There was no keyboard so checking e-mail was a very complicated and lengthy process and if he made one mistake he had to start all over. Rudy said, ""Merri, why don't you go get laid?"" Troy just sat there and I didn't know if he said that because he didn't want to show me how to e-mail or if he thought I was a loser with no boyfriend. And I said, ""It's not that easy for girls.""

You had to carry as many packs or cartons of cigarettes as you could hold in your hands and pockets--according to how much money was in your pockets and how much you could carry. They chose to smoke or not to smoke as part of the game. But to win you had to smoke a whole pack of cigarettes in 10 minutes. 20 cigarettes. In 3 rounds of the game show only girl was able to do it and she did it with ease. Those who chose not to smoke had to answer difficult geography questions.

33,"(unable to sleep from 11 p.m. until 3:30 a.m. due to excess racket from new disco under my window. Horns honking continually. Dream tape recorded after daylight. ) At the great big university pool, that's called a natatorium, the floor was a clayish sandy color and rubberized, so your toes could grip good. A small group of grown-ups was sitting cross legged on the side playing a game that looked like marbles. But the marbles were round symbols of the state of South Carolina. They were in 3 separate code colors: (there were actually 4 colors; silver, gold and white. But there were many white marbles. There was only one bronze colored marble--it meant the same as the white ones but was much more valuable because it was rare. One of the 'marbles' was really the top of a palmetto tree, but chopped off, so it really looked like a furball. The other was suppose to be the moon. {{the palmetto tree and moon are on the SC state flag. White on an indigo background.}} I forgot what the third one meant, but it meant something. The grown people were playing marbles with the state symbols. I had to walk around the pool. I tried to remember that lady's name who was my WSI teacher at USC-M-O-U-S.... but I couldn't. I remembered Butterball's name. She was sitting on the floor talking to Butterball. The thing that I couldn't remember was why I was there at the pool. (Walking around the pool) I was carrying a cooking pot with some leftovers from supper in it. And it was leftover beef stew. It was in a pot with a handle and I didn't have anywhere to put it. I couldn't put in the water. If I put it down on the rubberized floor it would probably melt it. In my other hand I was carrying the state symbol marbles. I didn't have any pockets to put my marbles in. On the way up I had to sit in the car with this girl and she was driving me crazy. I tried to remember what she was so riled up about. But she was very angry about something and she kept going, ""eek eek grrrr grrrr augh augh."" She was a filmmaker. We were doing a film shoot about prostitution. I was busy messing with the camera. I took the whole roll of pictures of these 2 shoes; men's work shoes (that'd been) spray painted black. The were aligned heel to toe but one was floating about 2 feet up in the air, so it looked like somebody was walking up steps, but just the shoes--not the person. I took all my pictures of that. The lower shoe was propped up on an aluminum can with the label peeled off. The shoes belonged to Woody Allen. We were going around the city because we had to do this film about prostitution. And this girl was just BOTHERING me and she wouldn't leave me alone, and I didn't have any money to give her. So after a while I just hauled off and I bit her in the arm as hard as I could. I bit her so hard that it was bleeding and you could see teeth marks on her arm. Then she was all self-righteous and she said, ""OH, I'm going to have to go to the hospital and get a TETANUS SHOT! People bites are worse than monkey bites, and monkey bites are worse than dog bites."" I said, ""Well, you don't have to go to the hospital right now. You have 48 hours before tetanus sets in."" She was worried it wouldn't heal. She went inside where the doctor was and went under the deck. She said, ""The doctor said to analyze and see if you're the one who bit me in the arm. To see if they're your teeth bite marks. So pull your teeth out and put them in my hand so we can see if you're the one who bit me."" I said, ""I told you I WAS the one who bit you, and I'm sorry but you wouldn't leave me alone. It's just what I had to do."" I was waiting in line to go to the bathroom and a little boy came and he tapped me on the arm. He said , ""I have something from the lady for you. I'm gonna put it in your raincoat pocket. Now don't look."" It was wrapped up in a napkin. I was at the NBA basketball championship. I didn't want to be doing what I was doing but I had to. There were about 18 chicks; girls like me, and we had to wear these cheerleader uniforms. Blue shorts with stars and red and white tops. We had to do this choreographed dance and be all SMILEY SMILEY and sing the Star Spangled Banner. It was just crazy.

And I asked her if she could tell me what the date was that the performance was going to be, and she didn't really know how to count; she kept getting all mixed up. She kept telling me, ""26, 25,"" and I kept telling her, ""I think you mean 12/25."" And she's like, ""Oh no, it says here 26, 25."" Wonder what that can mean?

And for some reason I was going on a website that I could look at the results of the Top 40 countdown, and the songs were listed from like 40 to 1 and they had these little icons next to them with pictures that were supposedly the pictures of the CD covers but really had nothing to do with the song. I think that comes from like in Word documents and things, you have a list and you've got these big icons and list information, and it's just all over in your face, which is how I like it. But that's the way it is. I was doing that, and I kind of left it there because I had a feeling that he was going to want to see it.

And I couldn't figure out why, but this is the really crazy part -- Uncle Charlie had these butterfly stickers -- not really stickers, but laminated pieces of cardboard with shiny hologram butterflies on them and birds and all kinds of crazy stuff, pictures of bicycles and birds and cars and just stuff, and they were all squares the size of mini disks, and he could slide them into the mini disk player instead of lifting the lid with the latch. He would slide them into to this like a slot, and he had this like projector thing in his pants, and he would hold the unit so that the front of it could send an infrared signal to the projector saying it would project it on a screen in my pants!

And then there was supposed to be a Celine Dion concert like the Las Vegas show, and apparently because it wasn't making too much money up there, it had to tour and it had to come down and go to another place. And so I was thinking, ""Oh, man, we don't even have to pay 80 bucks to get it; we're already in.""

C-171,"#C-171 (2004-07-27 (19)) I was at a courtyard place that they were going to have a concert, with Mom. It was a place that was sort of like The Amphitheater because it was a huge inclined thing with bleachers, and then at the back there was a drop-off and there was a courtyard down where people could mill around and shop and eat and stuff. And then there was another building, a few feet away from the first building, which had more bleachers on the roof so people could sit up there and still see what was on the stage. And I can't remember who was going to be in concert, but I think it was going to be somebody good. And I think we were milling around and stuff before the show and we were going to get something to eat. And we went into this building underneath the first set of bleachers, and we were looking around and talking to some people, and we were in a buffet thing. And it was like a buffet, but everything was labeled with a price. For example, one little quiche, which was the size of a quarter, was $3.00, and three stuffed mushrooms were $20.00. Even though it was so just like so expensive, we were like just sort of throwing things on our plate and we were going to like run out. And after we were done, after Mom was done filling up a plate for us, she'd like say, ""Come on, Jess, come this way,"" and she like disappeared. And I looked out in the hallway and all around the courtyard place, and I couldn't find her. And I didn't want to go up on the bleachers yet because you needed a ticket to get up there and she had our tickets. And I just sort of lost her. And I was wearing, at this time I was conscious that I was wearing a skirt and I was wearing stockings, and let me think how this went. I think I remember having something stashed in my underwear, but I don't remember what, and my stockings were falling down. And this man stops me in the middle of the courtyard and pulls up my skirt and says, ""Here, let me help you pull up your stockings."" And he started jibbling and jibbling and trying to pull up my stockings for me, and I said, ""No thank you. I can do it myself."" But he keeps trying to pull up my stockings. And then he stands there in the middle of the courtyard and puts his arms around me and starts talking, and thinks he can help me find Mom. But I really didn't believe him. And I don't remember how, but Mom and I eventually met up and she said that she had a ticket for right in front of the stage, in the front area, like in the drawing in an amphitheater it had the long dance floor in front; and a ticket for the highest row in the first set of bleachers. And she wanted us to experience each one and switch places in the middle of the show so we could compare the view from each seat thing. And she said that we should each have a cell phone so that we could call each other, but if there's a wild concert going on, I don't know how in heck we're going to hear each other.

C-198,"#C-198 (2004-09-15 (19)) Terri was trying to organize -- actually it was a person that was a cross between Terri and Mrs. Dougherty; I couldn't figure out who it was though. But she was trying to organize this musical play where people dance and sing, and the story line was supposed to be about a person who got sick and had to go to the hospital and recovered. And we were doing these things where we were building these fake beds and putting Styrofoam in them, and I was showing this lady how I could dance and spin on one foot and I could sing real elegantly so that I could be one of the characters. And I was showing her how I balance on one foot and spin and stuff. And there were three or four boys and another girl. I had a feeling that Christina and Danny were involved in this somehow. And there was one boy that she was calling Stanley, and I think I should say that the significance of Stanley's name is that in Sound & Vision there's a man named Stanley who was putting, installing a whole house audio system in a rural country back in the boonies somewhere, but I don't know what that means to the dream story. But anyway, I was going to be like the sound designer or something for this play show thing, and we needed to go to the fire station and record some fire engine things so that we could do the amb_______ shuffle thing. And we were at this fire station, and for some reason there weren't a lot of fire people around. But the fire station had a bedroom that looked just like Mom and Dad's bedroom, and I was in that bedroom with my mini disc recorder, and in this dream I could actually see the videos very well. There was LED instead of that LCD black on gray. Let's see, and out on the driveway in the garage area there was a truck there, and two of the fire guys were out there watching, and this Stanley was going to start up the truck and maneuver it around and run the things. And I ran a long wire with the lavaliere mike on it from my mini disc recorder in this bedroom out to a post by the truck, and I stuck it on a post, a little clip on the post. And I went back in the bedroom and I covered my ears with like cotton and stuff, because I was really scared of the sound he was going to make, but I could watch my reviews (?) and see that it was coming out. And so I was there, and let's see, I was watching the meters and I didn't see anything, and I didn't hear anything, but then about ten minutes later this boy named Stanley came in and he said, ""Did you get it?"" He told me, ""I backed the truck up and I went in a 360 degree circle and I ran the back-up alarm. Did you get it?"" And I said, ""No, I didn't get it. I didn't see anything in the meters."" And he said, ""I even ran the siren; did you get that?"" And I said, ""No, I didn't get that either."" And then I woke up. That was bizarre, man! How bizarre! How bizarre! I don't understand how this Stanley played into this thing, but I think this can have some kind of meaning to it. I'm not sure what though. ___________ bring out a couple of inhibitions that I might be having about once I get into the field, I might be having to record things and deal with things that might scare me a little bit and might dig up things, because stuff like that is rare, but it does surface and when it surfaces, you just have to deal with it. You've gotta just sort of, you know, you got to deal with it. And I think the part where he drove the truck backwards in a circle a few times so that he could run the back-up alarm, that comes from a little toy truck that Brittany had that would go in a circle and do that, and that was a very infamous thing back about, gee, I can't even remember when. And I think the part about the dancing and singing play comes from me thinking a lot about the Celine Dion show in Las Vegas, and how I would love to read a book about everything that went into that show and everything that they did, and how they decided to do just what they did.",jasmine.tsv,,0.027928483,-0.0016922653,0.13933268,-0.14918557,3

I had no idea what the play was about or what her character was. I just remember being so excited for her and so thrilled, and I came along, and I remember being able to pretty much come and go as I pleased. The Palladium was about half full, there was some audience. So pretty much whenever I wanted, I could come out front and watch the play or go backstage and diddle around. I remember the backstage area was kind of a white floor instead of how it really is, and there were different dressing rooms and stuff. And I remember one time when I was backstage I was dancing with the other cast. We were holding hands and kind of line dancing. We were all backstage. And sometimes Mom and I would hang out backstage and she had a little while before she had to go on again. And then it was like an hour's worth of intermission, believe it or not.

And the Teddy Bear Foundation was apparently a halfway good organization that gave teddy bears the tour of the hospital, but they were also like Tea Party zealots, and what they were doing was they were staging a protest because they thought the Palladium wasted too much public money and was too much of a drain on society.

There were also a clear plastic fork and spoon, and between them and the ice it was rather hard to get the lid on.",phil1.tsv,(1959-10-10),0.12536511,-0.01453197,-0.23826443,-0.06701692,2

1-105,"#1-105 (1959-11-02) There was something like a basement full of water, the entrance to which was very narrow, and you could only squeeze through on your belly.  Randy Creagar and his dad were there, and so was Judson Schinn.  I saw some fish swimming around and decided to go above and try to get a knife so that I could spear one.  However, when I started back, someone would not let me take the knife; they thought someone would get hurt.  However, I found one just as good below, and while I was hunting, someone told me Judson had already gotten a fish.  I got out again and climbed the rise along the railroad tracks along Acorn Pl.  He had the fish, a pretty nice-sized one, cut open and was cleaning it.  (Another note about the ""basement"": from the outside it was like an aquarium with the water and the people in it like an underground canal with a cutaway view.) I went back down the rise and some kids were sitting on a blanket and some newspapers.  One of the newspapers was open to the movies listings.  It seems that maybe Jody or Peggy were there, and some girl who was ""Charley's"" (Wallers, I believe) girlfriend-a rather young girl.  I don't remember whether Charley himself was there.  I liked the girl very much.  I asked how long she had been going out with him, and she said one (or maybe four) months.

I was going through the setting and came across two fellows playing cards, not for money, just sitting on the steps, sitting on the steps and playing some weird game of cards, stereo voice. There were probably 8 or 9, something like this. Then the scene changed after one of them had won a game of cards. Then the scene changed. Myself, a friend from my childhood, when I lived in New Jersey, John, and some man who I didn't know, and one other person decided to play a game of pool and it was on the kind of pool table you find in bars. About the two fellows were playing cards, I knew them they were familiar, but I don't remember who they were. I mean my relationship to them was familiar, but I don't remember who they were. I mean my relationship to them was familiar. The scene seemed to change quickly and one of the fellows who was playing cards seemed to be my brother Dave, 17.

It seems like they were words, which were underlined, but I can't make them out. It seems as if the group of smaller words were underlined.

Osceola-M-18,"#Osceola-M-18 (03/19/65) One part that comes back was standing in a hallway or rather alleyway of a large auditorium. The word I want is aisle of a large auditorium. In the auditorium were a large number of prominent people who were all seated there on wooden seats. In some ways it seems as if this was set out of doors, but I'm not certain of that. It seems I had just walked over toward the aisle and was pulling a piece of tape off of my throat. I had some difficulty doing this, and after I took the tape off, I looked at it and it was the same flesh-colored tape we use here, except part of it was completely transparent like Scotch tape, and I wondered if the flesh-colored part had still adhered to my throat or Adam's apple. It seemed that Jimmy Durante had just got up and had to leave the theater in a hurry, and then someone was saying that if they could be anybody in the whole world, they would like to be Jimmy Durante because he was such a  fine person and so well loved. Then I looked throughout the audience and it seemed as if Cary Grant were there, and I was imagining someone probably saying that they would like to be Cary Grant if they could be anybody in the world, because of his distinguished good looks and his overall handsomeness. Then I was sort of asking myself who would I want to be. It seemed as if I were wondering if I wanted to be Calvin because of all his scientific productivity and then his theoretical writings, but I don't believe I ever answered the question. The setting was in a basement, I believe, because it involved a cold storage vault. There were a large number of valuable furs in this one room, and I worked there in some capacity. It seems as if there were two shifts of girls involved here because one of the girls was just getting ready to leave. She was a young, attractive sort of red-haired girl, and as she was coming out of this one room of the vault, she said, ""Oh, are you still here?"" I said, ""Yes, you know me. I'm always on the job."" She then prepared to go home, and she said something to me that I cold not quite understand, and I asked her, ""Did you say A or B or C?"" B referred to alarm clock and A referred to something much more suggestive of sex and C was a completely neutral choice. I said, ""Which of those three things did you say? I have a preference in terms of what I hope you said,"" but it seemed as if she gave the neutral word. Then I said to her, ""Well, maybe someday I'll get to hear your alarm clock,"" and she seemed to be slightly embarrassed by what I had said. Then it seemed as if there were some other man in the vault with me, and he was saying something about I was trying to make time, and I said, yes, I didn't seem to have gotten very far, but this gal was warming up a little bit. Then some other girl appeared and it seemed as if it were her shift that was now starting. I said something to her about, ""Your accent seems much more southern today than it did yesterday."" I said something about, ""You really are a you-all type today."" I believe she mentioned something about having visited with her parents or her in-laws that day and they were very southern, and so this is why she was talking this way now. Then I noticed the coats that were hung along in the storage vault, and I thought that since this was not very large and it was expensive to store things there, that they should make more efficient use of the space than they did. There were several spots that were untidy and things had been sort of scattered about. Somehow this vault seemed connected with sleep research because this first girl seemed to say, ""Are you still going on with the sleeping or dreaming?"" and in that sense it seemed to have some kind of lab aspect to the vault. Then the setting shifted to a top story of an old building. I was talking on the telephone to someone who I believe was named David Peterson. I was trying to write down some information, and it seemed like as I talked to him, I was reminded that I had talked to him earlier and had written down the information that was needed, but I now couldn't find it because the papers were all scattered about and the desk or area nearby was untidy. Then I apologized, saying that I had just gotten up from being a subject. I was kind of fuzzy in my thinking. Then I momentarily felt that this was a bad thing to say because we were thinking of using him as a subject, and this might scare him off if he thought that there were some sort of adverse aftereffects to it. But then it seemed as if he were calling me because he was at the University of Miami and wanted to do a dissertation on dreams, and it was to be on the effect of cold, acids, or cold solutions of some sorts. Then I asked him to repeat the information in terms of where his meeting was to be held and what time. I said that this time I would make sure that I got it written down. He said that it would be held on November 16th, and I said that would be easy enough to remember because it was my birthday. Now what place would it be? He said he wasn't sure, but it seemed like it would be so and so place. Then it seemed as if I was still talking, but the setting shifted very slightly, and I was now standing up with my elbows on some sort of desk, and I was near an open window looking out the window. This fellow started pressuring me about the exam that was to be held about over his dissertation, and he asked how thorough would he have to master the literature. I said he would have to know it very well but we would not ask him specific questions on it like what did Schwartz do in 1957. At this point it seemed as if three girls from my nursing class walked behind me, one in particular who I think her code name is Charlie the Tuna, and they were all laughing over this conversation and seemed to be amazed at the lightness involved and good humor that was being displayed because they did not expect this kind of attitude or conduct from their teachers. They expected a much more harsh disciplinarian. Then I was explaining to this fellow that since he's going to be doing a dissertation at the University of Miami, we certainly expect a competent job to be done, etc., and all I could tell him was we would be asking questions more about his design in terms of why did he use a certain kind of statistic or some other kind, why he had used the controls he had used, and that nobody was out to give him a bad time. If he had a fairly solid design and presented it, that was all there was to it. At this point I looked down below into the street and Alan Sternberg, a student who had also been in therapy with me, was walking by and seemed to be looking up in my direction, and I thought I hadn't seen him in some time and thought that he was looking for me. Then the conversation continued with this student and he finally said, ""So what?"" I just answered him back, ""So what? What do you mean, so what?"" Then it seemed that the setting shifted to the front of this room, and now this student was there in person. He was heavy set with a reddish brush cut and one eye that seemed perhaps to have a glass eye, freckled, timid and not too bright-looking. Here were a couple of other people scattered around. One of them seemed to be the chairman of the department, and I think it was Calvin who was the chairman. I think there were two women present and then some older woman who was in her sixties came in who was explaining about the mail or where her records were kept. I seemed a little unclear on this, and then one of the women said, ""Well, we keep them straight across the hall because the main departmental offices are in another building and because it's difficult to get over there, we have sort of a mail service here in this building."" Then there was some discussion about how handy it would be when the department had another separate department headquarters in this building. It seemed as if the department were ready to branch out to two divisions, and I agreed that it would certainly be more handy when it was located there. Since I still seemed to be unsure about these records, Calvin sort of nodded and one of the women got up to go over and get the forms or material for me that seemed to be needed. Then the setting shifted again, and Calvin was saying something to me, but he seemed to be demonstrating the point by tapping lightly on my lower abdomen, which was making me annoyed. Then it seemed as if Calvin were in the room here and I was relating a dream to him, and we were having a discussion about dream or something related to it. All of a sudden I heard the EEG machine stop, and I said to him, ""Did you run out of paper, because the machine was just running and now suddenly it's stopped."" He looked at me and sort of smiled, and said something about, ""Well, you knew that I would take care of everything the way it should be taken care of."" Then Calvin did walk into the room in reality to awaken me. Estimated time would be about 10 minutes.",miami-lab.tsv,(03/19/65),0.073613204,-0.11263417,-0.054717712,-0.12271925,2
Osceola-M-21,"#Osceola-M-21 (03/10/64) There were two male newscasters present and one of them was reading the news. He came across an item dealing with some new scientific information about oceanography, but had difficulty with making these statements so he ended that particular piece of news, so he continued on with other information. After a few minutes when he had finished with the news, he then said, ""Now, I would like to give you the information about that other news item which was a little bit garbled before. Here is the way that statement should have read."" He then proceeded to very carefully read this off. Now it seemed as if there were some other woman present at the same time, and both of the male announcers were there carefully looking at this skirt while the announcement was being slowly read.  One word they were having difficulty in pronouncing was cataclysm. It seems as if they were saying that this is past tense of the verb to something and the word seemed cataclysm, but that isn't an infinitive. At the conclusion of this broadcast, there was some sort of contest where the announcer who had not been involved with reading the news, was now giving out some sort of information and then people were supposed to react to this with questions or comments or something to his statements. This woman who was mentioned earlier was going along and asking some different questions. It seemed as if somehow there must have been other people standing nearby or involved because none of them were saying anything. It seemed as if there were a little bit of annoyance at this woman because she was much involved with the question, and then the news announcer reminded that there was an $8 prize for the person who had asked the most questions or cooperated in whatever fashion it was that was expected of people in reaction to this information. The next part of the dream seemed to have involved some sort of intrigue or spy element. There was some earlier part that I can't recall as I'm not sure what information it was that was supposed to be kept secret or who all was involved in the plot. At this one point it seemed that a group of people were together. One of them is a friend of mine whose name is Dave Long and then there was some attractive woman who looked like one of the nursing students. There were several other people involved. They were all in the room and then it seemed as if Dave and this woman were the principle culprits and they were trying to escape. They were on some sort of subway like device or else an elevator that ran sidewards. They were supposed to get off at this one particular stop, but they didn't. Instead the machine that they were on which seemed to look more like the elevator arrangement inside whizzed by this one stop and the people inside seemed to be hardly aware that they had rapidly passed by. Then in order to throw people off the track, he decided to get off with this girl at a dentist kind of place thinking that no one would ever look for them there. It seemed as at one point when they were moving along in this vehicle that they looked out and there was a large auditorium filled with about ten or twelve people scattered throughout all of them very busily picking their teeth with a toothpick. When they stopped to get out of this vehicle it seemed as if I were there and it was some form of hallway. As Dave went by, I think it was myself than who had a bowl of brown cereal and I attempted to deliberately smear this on him so that he would have to alter his plans slightly. He was wearing a suit and I did manage to get quite a bit of this brown cereal all over the bottom of his right sleeve. He was annoyed over this, but then he and the girl started into this large room. As they got down to the end of this room, it seemed that Doris was there and she was saying something about coming into the room or being time to come into the room. This seemed to take place just before Calvin came thru the door or perhaps even before he had come thru the door. The momentary fleeting impression might have been to do with it being time for him to come thru the door. Time would have seemed like 11 or 12 minutes as the news broadcast took a while to unfold. In terms of the news broadcast element, I appeared to be an observer throughout all of it except for the terminal part when I was a participant in terms of being in the audience. During the chase scene it seemed as if I were participating in a fragment I can't recall. Then I was an onlooker as the car went by its one destination or stop point and could see the car going by and see the people looking out the glass doors of the station where they were supposed to have gotten off. Then I appeared to be a participant as it seemed as if I were in this car looking out to the auditorium where the people were picking their teeth, but then it seemed as f I were both participant and onlooker in the latter part. I could see myself being in this hallway when they had emerged from the car.",miami-lab.tsv,(03/10/64),0.0540978,-0.10418646,0.089735195,-0.07967747,3

Sam-R-3,"#Sam-R-3 (02/21/64) I was out in the country and lived next door to Dr. Paff. The entrance to his house was unusual. There were these two short converging brick walls with a white concrete plaque in between. This led by a short open space to a six-sided open affair with a brick floor (gazebo-like). The house had a library (the books were similar to the ones here upstairs. In fact, the library looked the same as the central room upstairs). I was outside sitting on the curb when a car pulled up and a doctor (M.D.) rushed into the house. When he came out, Dr. Paff had arrived (on foot) and the doctor said, ""George, your wife is dead of a heart attack."" George said no crude instrument could determine that--and he went into the house to see for himself. He came out and agreed with the doctor and they both thought it was quite funny that his wife was dead. In fact, they were both laughing. Then the doctor said, ""Too bad, no more $300.00 a month and it was a nice library she had purchased for you, even if it was used.""",miami-lab.tsv,(02/21/64),0.0038011037,-0.011493504,-0.025277693,-0.0784999,2

I came back in and switched the dial, and Walter Cronkite was just coming on the local CBS channel.  He seemed rather disorganized, and the picture wasn't very good, but I was still torn between watching that or Father Knows Best, which I hadn't seen in a long time.

First, though, there were twin restaurants, of the franchise kiosk-style type, on either side of a parking lot.  Each one had a carhop with an enormous papier-mâché head of a horse or donkey, which made them almost as big as the kiosk itself.  The Howard Johnson restaurant, on the other hand, was mounted about halfway up a tower of about three or four stories in height.  The restaurant was round, considerably exceeded the tower in diameter, and slowly revolved.  For some reason, I felt compelled to ridicule the idea and the people eating there.  Actually, though, I thought it would be a good way to get a panoramic view of the surrounding area.  We went into a restaurant, but it wasn't that one.  It reminds me of the place we ate lunch in Paris just before leaving-rather stark, with dark brown benches.  There were a couple of very pregnant women sitting on benches, and a couple of others came in while we were there.  They were unmarried and were talking about having abortions-apparently that's what they were there at the ""restaurant"" for.

Another official raised his glass for a toast, and when he had given it, he flipped his glass sharply with a deft motion, to Husak, who was several feet away.

And I didn't want to go up on the bleachers yet because you needed a ticket to get up there and she had our tickets. And I just sort of lost her. And I was wearing, at this time I was conscious that I was wearing a skirt and I was wearing stockings, and let me think how this went. I think I remember having something stashed in my underwear, but I don't remember what, and my stockings were falling down. And this man stops me in the middle of the courtyard and pulls up my skirt and says, ""Here, let me help you pull up your stockings."" And he started jibbling and jibbling and trying to pull up my stockings for me, and I said, ""No thank you. I can do it myself."" But he keeps trying to pull up my stockings. And then he stands there in the middle of the courtyard and puts his arms around me and starts talking, and thinks he can help me find Mom. But I really didn't believe him. And I don't remember how, but Mom and I eventually met up and she said that she had a ticket for right in front of the stage, in the front area, like in the drawing in an amphitheater it had the long dance floor in front; and a ticket for the highest row in the first set of bleachers. And she wanted us to experience each one and switch places in the middle of the show so we could compare the view from each seat thing. And she said that we should each have a cell phone so that we could call each other, but if there's a wild concert going on, I don't know how in heck we're going to hear each other.

C-198,"#C-198 (2004-09-15 (19)) Terri was trying to organize -- actually it was a person that was a cross between Terri and Mrs. Dougherty; I couldn't figure out who it was though. But she was trying to organize this musical play where people dance and sing, and the story line was supposed to be about a person who got sick and had to go to the hospital and recovered. And we were doing these things where we were building these fake beds and putting Styrofoam in them, and I was showing this lady how I could dance and spin on one foot and I could sing real elegantly so that I could be one of the characters. And I was showing her how I balance on one foot and spin and stuff. And there were three or four boys and another girl. I had a feeling that Christina and Danny were involved in this somehow. And there was one boy that she was calling Stanley, and I think I should say that the significance of Stanley's name is that in Sound & Vision there's a man named Stanley who was putting, installing a whole house audio system in a rural country back in the boonies somewhere, but I don't know what that means to the dream story. But anyway, I was going to be like the sound designer or something for this play show thing, and we needed to go to the fire station and record some fire engine things so that we could do the amb_______ shuffle thing. And we were at this fire station, and for some reason there weren't a lot of fire people around. But the fire station had a bedroom that looked just like Mom and Dad's bedroom, and I was in that bedroom with my mini disc recorder, and in this dream I could actually see the videos very well. There was LED instead of that LCD black on gray. Let's see, and out on the driveway in the garage area there was a truck there, and two of the fire guys were out there watching, and this Stanley was going to start up the truck and maneuver it around and run the things. And I ran a long wire with the lavaliere mike on it from my mini disc recorder in this bedroom out to a post by the truck, and I stuck it on a post, a little clip on the post. And I went back in the bedroom and I covered my ears with like cotton and stuff, because I was really scared of the sound he was going to make, but I could watch my reviews (?) and see that it was coming out. And so I was there, and let's see, I was watching the meters and I didn't see anything, and I didn't hear anything, but then about ten minutes later this boy named Stanley came in and he said, ""Did you get it?"" He told me, ""I backed the truck up and I went in a 360 degree circle and I ran the back-up alarm. Did you get it?"" And I said, ""No, I didn't get it. I didn't see anything in the meters."" And he said, ""I even ran the siren; did you get that?"" And I said, ""No, I didn't get that either."" And then I woke up. That was bizarre, man! How bizarre! How bizarre! I don't understand how this Stanley played into this thing, but I think this can have some kind of meaning to it. I'm not sure what though. ___________ bring out a couple of inhibitions that I might be having about once I get into the field, I might be having to record things and deal with things that might scare me a little bit and might dig up things, because stuff like that is rare, but it does surface and when it surfaces, you just have to deal with it. You've gotta just sort of, you know, you got to deal with it. And I think the part where he drove the truck backwards in a circle a few times so that he could run the back-up alarm, that comes from a little toy truck that Brittany had that would go in a circle and do that, and that was a very infamous thing back about, gee, I can't even remember when. And I think the part about the dancing and singing play comes from me thinking a lot about the Celine Dion show in Las Vegas, and how I would love to read a book about everything that went into that show and everything that they did, and how they decided to do just what they did.",jasmine-all.tsv,,0.027928483,-0.0016922653,0.13933268,-0.14918557,3

But there were a lot of us there and we got this great big packet of stuff, and there were these different presenters giving speeches to us. And somebody -- I think it was Mr. Dawson -- was talking to us about how to diagram something to show the form, and usually a form chart doesn't look like it, but there was all this like tree branches all over the page. And it was apparently showing how a composition was going. And then, before that, there was somebody talking about him playing, and we were talking about picking the right music for the right things.

D-073,"#D-073 (2011-08-20 (26)) Mom was acting in a play at the Palladium, and I had the feeling that it was kind of like when she would do a dance recital, except she wasn't in a dance recital, it was actually acting in a play. I had no idea what the play was about or what her character was. I just remember being so excited for her and so thrilled, and I came along, and I remember being able to pretty much come and go as I pleased. The Palladium was about half full, there was some audience. So pretty much whenever I wanted, I could come out front and watch the play or go backstage and diddle around. I remember the backstage area was kind of a white floor instead of how it really is, and there were different dressing rooms and stuff. And I remember one time when I was backstage I was dancing with the other cast. We were holding hands and kind of line dancing. We were all backstage. And sometimes Mom and I would hang out backstage and she had a little while before she had to go on again. And then it was like an hour's worth of intermission, believe it or not. There was like a whole hour before the second half, and for some reason in my dream the Palladium was right next to the park, kind of where the baseball diamond is and where the t____ place is. So we got to walk around the lake and we were stopping at a water fountain sink-like type station to wash my hands and take a drink, I think. And for some reason she thought my face was dirty, so she was washing my face. And just about that moment there was a horrible horn honking and siren blaring going on, and she's holding by the face and she's washing my face, and I broke away and started running away. And as it turned out, it wasn't a fire truck or an ambulance or anything normal. It was some kind of a boat that was in the lake and it was from something called the Teddy Bear Foundation. And the Teddy Bear Foundation was apparently a halfway good organization that gave teddy bears the tour of the hospital, but they were also like Tea Party zealots, and what they were doing was they were staging a protest because they thought the Palladium wasted too much public money and was too much of a drain on society. And somehow I was able to jump in the lake and swim across the lake as a shortcut to actually walking around the rest of the lake. And then Mom and I walked through the place where the scoreboard is, where I used to hide in the bushes. We walked all through that area and cut across this field, and then we were able to get back to the Palladium on time, and I can't remember any more of that part, but I do remember the part where we got home and Mom and Dad were fighting as per usual, and Dad was kind of wondering, ""Well gee, what were you doing there all that time?"" meaning he knew that Mom was in a play, but what in the world was I doing there? Well, I told him that sitting backstage in the wings I could actually see the play better from instead of sitting out front further away, and, of course, that was baloney, but it sounded good to him.

The kids were chasing these little children away and wouldn't let them play, and I didn't think that was fair and so it became a real scene. I went with one of these little children, or maybe a couple of them, over to the -- all these children's swings were on trees, and I went over to this tree not too far from where they were playing where these tree crabs live. And these didn't look like any ordinary crabs because they had only four legs instead of -- how many do they have -- 12? They didn't have any real big claws on them, but we were trying to chase this big one to these other trees, and it wasn't very easy because it would keep scrambling up trees that we would pass and we kept getting them down. And finally it scuttled up to this hollow place, and scuttled way back inside of that, but there were a lot of baby crabs on this tree. So we got a small one and finally got it over to the playground where the kids were and let it go and trying to make it go up the tree because we sort of wanted it to bother the kids because they hadn't been nice. It didn't seem to bother them particularly.

And here's how the story line basically went: there was this girl who lived in this big house and she was sick and tired of being a servant. And that's the girl that Celine Dion played. And her two sisters were kind of competing to marry this rich guy, and one of the sisters died and one of the sisters found somebody else.

C-171,"#C-171 (2004-07-27 (19)) I was at a courtyard place that they were going to have a concert, with Mom. It was a place that was sort of like The Amphitheater because it was a huge inclined thing with bleachers, and then at the back there was a drop-off and there was a courtyard down where people could mill around and shop and eat and stuff. And then there was another building, a few feet away from the first building, which had more bleachers on the roof so people could sit up there and still see what was on the stage. And I can't remember who was going to be in concert, but I think it was going to be somebody good. And I think we were milling around and stuff before the show and we were going to get something to eat. And we went into this building underneath the first set of bleachers, and we were looking around and talking to some people, and we were in a buffet thing. And it was like a buffet, but everything was labeled with a price. For example, one little quiche, which was the size of a quarter, was $3.00, and three stuffed mushrooms were $20.00. Even though it was so just like so expensive, we were like just sort of throwing things on our plate and we were going to like run out. And after we were done, after Mom was done filling up a plate for us, she'd like say, ""Come on, Jess, come this way,"" and she like disappeared. And I looked out in the hallway and all around the courtyard place, and I couldn't find her. And I didn't want to go up on the bleachers yet because you needed a ticket to get up there and she had our tickets. And I just sort of lost her. And I was wearing, at this time I was conscious that I was wearing a skirt and I was wearing stockings, and let me think how this went. I think I remember having something stashed in my underwear, but I don't remember what, and my stockings were falling down. And this man stops me in the middle of the courtyard and pulls up my skirt and says, ""Here, let me help you pull up your stockings."" And he started jibbling and jibbling and trying to pull up my stockings for me, and I said, ""No thank you. I can do it myself."" But he keeps trying to pull up my stockings. And then he stands there in the middle of the courtyard and puts his arms around me and starts talking, and thinks he can help me find Mom. But I really didn't believe him. And I don't remember how, but Mom and I eventually met up and she said that she had a ticket for right in front of the stage, in the front area, like in the drawing in an amphitheater it had the long dance floor in front; and a ticket for the highest row in the first set of bleachers. And she wanted us to experience each one and switch places in the middle of the show so we could compare the view from each seat thing. And she said that we should each have a cell phone so that we could call each other, but if there's a wild concert going on, I don't know how in heck we're going to hear each other.

C-198,"#C-198 (2004-09-15 (19)) Terri was trying to organize -- actually it was a person that was a cross between Terri and Mrs. Dougherty; I couldn't figure out who it was though. But she was trying to organize this musical play where people dance and sing, and the story line was supposed to be about a person who got sick and had to go to the hospital and recovered. And we were doing these things where we were building these fake beds and putting Styrofoam in them, and I was showing this lady how I could dance and spin on one foot and I could sing real elegantly so that I could be one of the characters. And I was showing her how I balance on one foot and spin and stuff. And there were three or four boys and another girl. I had a feeling that Christina and Danny were involved in this somehow. And there was one boy that she was calling Stanley, and I think I should say that the significance of Stanley's name is that in Sound & Vision there's a man named Stanley who was putting, installing a whole house audio system in a rural country back in the boonies somewhere, but I don't know what that means to the dream story. But anyway, I was going to be like the sound designer or something for this play show thing, and we needed to go to the fire station and record some fire engine things so that we could do the amb_______ shuffle thing. And we were at this fire station, and for some reason there weren't a lot of fire people around. But the fire station had a bedroom that looked just like Mom and Dad's bedroom, and I was in that bedroom with my mini disc recorder, and in this dream I could actually see the videos very well. There was LED instead of that LCD black on gray. Let's see, and out on the driveway in the garage area there was a truck there, and two of the fire guys were out there watching, and this Stanley was going to start up the truck and maneuver it around and run the things. And I ran a long wire with the lavaliere mike on it from my mini disc recorder in this bedroom out to a post by the truck, and I stuck it on a post, a little clip on the post. And I went back in the bedroom and I covered my ears with like cotton and stuff, because I was really scared of the sound he was going to make, but I could watch my reviews (?) and see that it was coming out. And so I was there, and let's see, I was watching the meters and I didn't see anything, and I didn't hear anything, but then about ten minutes later this boy named Stanley came in and he said, ""Did you get it?"" He told me, ""I backed the truck up and I went in a 360 degree circle and I ran the back-up alarm. Did you get it?"" And I said, ""No, I didn't get it. I didn't see anything in the meters."" And he said, ""I even ran the siren; did you get that?"" And I said, ""No, I didn't get that either."" And then I woke up. That was bizarre, man! How bizarre! How bizarre! I don't understand how this Stanley played into this thing, but I think this can have some kind of meaning to it. I'm not sure what though. ___________ bring out a couple of inhibitions that I might be having about once I get into the field, I might be having to record things and deal with things that might scare me a little bit and might dig up things, because stuff like that is rare, but it does surface and when it surfaces, you just have to deal with it. You've gotta just sort of, you know, you got to deal with it. And I think the part where he drove the truck backwards in a circle a few times so that he could run the back-up alarm, that comes from a little toy truck that Brittany had that would go in a circle and do that, and that was a very infamous thing back about, gee, I can't even remember when.

D-073,"#D-073 (2011-08-20 (26)) Mom was acting in a play at the Palladium, and I had the feeling that it was kind of like when she would do a dance recital, except she wasn't in a dance recital, it was actually acting in a play.

I remember the backstage area was kind of a white floor instead of how it really is, and there were different dressing rooms and stuff. And I remember one time when I was backstage I was dancing with the other cast. We were holding hands and kind of line dancing. We were all backstage. And sometimes Mom and I would hang out backstage and she had a little while before she had to go on again. And then it was like an hour's worth of intermission, believe it or not.

And for some reason she thought my face was dirty, so she was washing my face. And just about that moment there was a horrible horn honking and siren blaring going on, and she's holding by the face and she's washing my face, and I broke away and started running away. And as it turned out, it wasn't a fire truck or an ambulance or anything normal. It was some kind of a boat that was in the lake and it was from something called the Teddy Bear Foundation. And the Teddy Bear Foundation was apparently a halfway good organization that gave teddy bears the tour of the hospital, but they were also like Tea Party zealots, and what they were doing was they were staging a protest because they thought the Palladium wasted too much public money and was too much of a drain on society. And somehow I was able to jump in the lake and swim across the lake as a shortcut to actually walking around the rest of the lake.

In this class each one of the students had to expose a theme that would attract general attention. First it was Mary Ann's (a classmate) turn. She did it very well and was applauded by the audience. The second one to speak was a boy named Edgar (also a classmate, very intelligent, cultured and able, whom I admire especially). He spoke brilliantly about Sophocles's tragedies. Then it was Louise's turn (a friend and classmate). She spoke alright, but was not able to narrow down her topic very well. Afterwards, Roland (a quite intelligent classmate) exposed his topic. I don't remember well what he spoke of or how well he did it. The fifth one to speak was Cindy (a friend and classmate, an intelligent and quite studious girl). But something strange happened with her, because instead of exposing a theme, the same as the others, she began to hum a song and to sing and dance. Together with her performance she presented another great number: it turned out that this girl had the power to transform herself into birds of multi-colored plumage and butterflies of extremely beautiful colors; besides she could transform her surroundings, changing the lighting. I believe it would be hard for me to explain the beautiful picture I had before my eyes. At last Cindy finished her performance and was applauded most of all. The last one to present a theme (which was I) did not fare so well. First, I did not know whether to give a talk or sing as the one before me had done. Finally, I decided on the latter, but in the meantime, the auditorium had been emptied, and the only ones left listening were Louise, the teacher, and Roland. In short, I was in a ridiculous situation, but I did not care and continued to sing until the end. Louise came over and started to make some criticisms; I was silent and accepted it. Going out, I tried to find Cindy. Once I found her I asked to explain how she had acquired those wonderful gifts. Cindy told me that it was Saint Martin who had given them to her. I continued to ask whether it was the black saint or Jose de San Martin. It was the latter who had given her those gifts as compensation for the effort that Cindy made in her studies and for having an altruistic spirit. But before this Cindy told me that to get in touch with San Martin, one had to go to the cemetery and stand watch by his grave all night. I thought that it was all a fantasy, an realizable dream, but perhaps it could turn into reality.

I said that I was planning to watch Richard Wagner's symphony on TV. Soon, the program began. But the music sounded more like Gustav Mahler's. He is my favorite composer, but I didn't know for sure which symphony was being played. I just knew it was Mahler's, but not Wagner's. TV was showing pictures of the cosmos and a woman in white dress dancing. The woman seemed to be lost to meditation. It was an extraordinarily beautiful sight. Everybody else in the room gazed at the screen. I was still trying to figure out whose music it was. When the first movement ended, TV screened the title of the second movement. It had a name of some comet, which I was not familiar with. But I understood that the music was Gustav Holst's, ""The Planets."" (This is ridiculous because no movement in ""The Planets"" has a name of unknown comet.) Suddenly, I heard an alarm and noticed that the whole room was trembling. I went out of the room and found that I was inside of a big battleship.
