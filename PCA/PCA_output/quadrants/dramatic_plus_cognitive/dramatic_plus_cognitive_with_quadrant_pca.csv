051-2,"#051-2 Real life: My friends and I just bought an eight-track recorder so that the band I'm in could record some songs. Dream: I get home from school one day and these two kids, kids that I know I've seen at Suffolk but don't really know or talk to, are down in my basement. They are playing with the new eight-track recorder. I was worried that they were going to break it. I went upstairs for something and when I came downstairs one of these kids told me he had to use my bathroom. For some reason all the lights were out and my basement seemed distorted. When we finally found the bathroom after some difficulty, I went into the bathroom and, this is disgusting, but I vomited through my nose.

Then we went to a woman's house.(The woman was in my science lab last year in real life. I had asked her out but she said no.) We went into her basement, my friends and I, and turned on the TV. Home Improvement was on, which is the only show I'll watch on occasion. But I wasn't paying attention to the show all the time. I was wondering how I was going to ask her out again.

051-4,"#051-4 I have to bring up a recurring dream because it has great significance to the dream I had this week: dream #5. It always starts the same way. I walk down the stairs in my house and out the front door. I walk into the street and I always turn left. I lift my arms up to be perpendicular to my body and wait. Soon a big wind comes by and lifts me up. At first I am nervous. I am afraid of falling. I have no control over what I'm doing and the wind takes me where it wants. If the wind dies down I begin to fall or a large breeze makes me move quickly through the air and I get nervous. But soon I get comfortable with flying and I can turn in any direction I want. The wind dies down less often. I go higher and higher, often I get scared and come down a bit, but when the fear leaves I go higher than I previously was. Eventually I get the hang of flying and am comfortable with it, but I still feel as though somehow I'm missing something. Once I get the hang of flying I often realize that I've got no place to fly to. The dream ends with me kind of floating around aimlessly. I've had dreams along the lines of this one many many times.",college-m.tsv,,0.28811142,-0.29350752,-0.088854335,-0.28328145
052-1,"#052-1 In this dream I found myself on a type of spaceship. The inside looked like the starship Enterprise. This is strange because I really don't like Star Trek. For some reason a door is sliding open and closed, and I am shooting a laser at the opposite wall trying to hit two blinking discs. The laser I'm using isn't working so I switch to something stronger. The first beam was a red beam and this one is now a yellow one. I finally hit one and go out into the hall, walk a little way and enter a room with a sliding door. There is a girl dressed as I am, in some kind of uniform. The girl is someone I know from high school. I can't really remember what made me shoot but I did. The laser hit her in the foot taking a big chunk out. I remember seeing the chunk missing in graphic detail. I remember feeling ashamed I shot her and sad also. That was the end of the dream.

This object is towering over the trees. I remember feeling afraid of it but going closer anyway. When I am close to it the side splits vertically. A huge elephant comes running out at me. I get out of the way and proceed to watch all sorts of wild animals run through. I think I walked through the split after the animals went through and I'm in my old hgh school.

053-1,"#053-1 I have an acquaintance, Mark, who offered me a job which I declined. He turned out to be very respectable and has a clear perspective on many issues we are both interested in. I don't know him too well but consider him to be a reliable and trustworthy friend. Through the course of our discussions he has made mention of his homosexuality. I know very few gay men, and have not an iota of respect for the majority of them. Mark is different, in my perspective, though. I had this dream, last night, though. I was meeting Mark and we decided, mutually, to meet at his house. He opened the door wearing a very feminine fake-silk robe with a chiffon collar. This didn't scare me; it pissed me off. I controlled my anger and told him, forthright, that I didn't find his attire appropriate to the occasion, which was just a social meeting to talk about current happenings in our lives -- specifically, his lover just left him, and my lover, who is a heterosexual female to compliment my heterosexual maleness has recently left me. I told him, straightforth, that I was not going to have sex with him . . . ""So go change your clothes, or I'll be leaving and we can keep things between us on a professional level.""

053-2,"#053-2 I dreamed that I was laying alone in bed, rousting from a nap, to find that I had a split in the skin underneath my left nipple. It was not bleeding but it was tender and painful.

053-3,"#053-3 I dreamt that I woke up next to my girlfriend (which is not altogether unusual, as we spend most nights together), or rather, my former girlfriend as we have broken up but still sleep together. Sounds odd, I know, but it seems to work for us. So I woke up and noticed how pretty she is (I commented on this to myself in the dream) and just kept looking. I was feeling her side, just above her hips, (which I also found to be beautiful and commented to myself accordingly). I kissed her shoulder and her neck just below the ear and climbed out of bed to smoke a cigarette. Next thing I know I am dressed and smoking and taking a leak into the toilet. I go back to the bedroom because it is warm in there and I felt very cold in the rest of the apartment. Her alarm goes off, she climbs out of bed and I turn off the alarm, also a ritual. I get undressed and go back to sleep while she goes to shower. She comes back wet and climbs into bed and puts her arms around me. She is very warm although I feel cold from somewhere. Then she is gone and the bed is wet and cold but I stay and I am shivering. I notice someone else in the room. I don't know who it is but it is sexually exciting. Next thing I know I am awake and my friend/girlfriend is happy to see me and I am happy to see her.

I was alone. I mean there was no one around and (this is funny) no cars on the streets, passing or parked. There were no cars. So I was walking up Charles Street and the next thing I know I am walking into this dead end of a street also on Beacon Hill. Three guys jump me and I fight back. They say, ""Give us your wallet."" I say, ""I'll give you just the money,"" and they say, ""Give us your leg."" I use a fake leg for walking (not just in the dream, real life, too). I say no.

All of a sudden two of them ran across my car from the hood to the trunk. My hood had a huge dent in it and they cracked my moonroof. I ran after them and they came and saw the damage they had caused to my car. While they were at my car a police car drove by. I told them to come over and they did. They told the boys they should pay for what they had done. The boys agreed to setup a payment plan with me to pay for the damage. I can remember putting a trash bag over the moonroof to prevent leaking of rain into the car. I called the boys to ask them when they would give me the money.

054-4,#054-4 I had a dream that I was younger. I was over at a friend's house during the summer. We (people I used to be friendly with) were playing gin by the pool. I remember that I wanted to go home. I kept looking at my watch. I saw on my watch that I did not have to stay much longer. They did not want me to leave because they could not continue to play gin. I wanted to go home but I did not want to say it to them. Then my alarm went off. I got out of that situation.,college-m.tsv,,0.49900743,-0.26513675,0.2369497,-0.01607306
055-1,"#055-1 My first dream occurred the 17th of November. Although it was not as scary as previous ones, it was very confusing. The first recall was my grandmother's house in Venezuela. I think the family was having a party for whatever the reason. The confusing part is when I bump into my friends (high school friends) from Miami. I felt guilty when seeing them because I did not invite any of them to my sister's wedding last August, 1992. (My reasons for not inviting them included inconsideration and neglect from them., e.g., every time I was in Miami for the holidays/vacations, I would call them to make plans. Unfortunately, they had their excuses and/or made plans with me but never followed up on them. During my grandmother's party they neglected me again and would not even look at me. Suddenly my dream shifts from those high school friends to one kid named Joey Levy. During my sixth and seventh grade years, this kid became my so-called friend. His mother and my father attended high school in Venezuela years ago. The Levys also lived in Miami and therefore gave Joey and me a reason to become friends. Joey was the cynical, sarcastic kid who I hated. Through Joey, I was able to meet his two friends, Mark Cedar and Maurice Gabay. The one thing we had in common was soccer. We played for ""K-Land."" They played in the 71-A team while I played on the 70-B team. They were better athletes than I was. I therefore always envied them. Anyway, the friendship between these three guys and myself soon disappeared after my Bar-Mitzvah. I took the big initiative not to invite Mark Cedar (because I didn't like the way he treated me in camp the previous summer. I was hurt and angry at him.) This was a big soap opera during those years. Afterwards, Joey would make me feel guilty for not inviting Mark. Back at my grandmother's, Joey had clearly changed. He was no longer the pain-in-the-butt, sarcastic rascal. He went to Israel after high school and came back a pot-smoking liberal. I actually felt comfortable with him for once. However, he did seem depressed for reasons unknown. He told me that Mark received a tennis scholarship to Frostburg State University in Maryland. Similarly, Maurice received a soccer scholarship to Florida State where he was the leading scorer and star of the team.",college-m.tsv,,0.19608635,-0.28407478,-0.048705917,-0.22307816
055-2,"#055-2 My second dream included one of my biggest fears: sharks. I can only remember few details and therefore the end of the dream is quite distorted. The setting takes place on the water. I was accompanied by a ""mother-figure"" in her late thirties. Also, there were approximately four kids with us. The scary part occurs when a shark (the same shark from ""Jaws"" the movie) eats one of the kids. The rest of us jump on the closest dock for our protection and safety. The setting suddenly shifts from the dock to the cafeteria of Camp Shalom. (I attended Camp Shalom when I was a youngster.) There were townspeople from Orange Springs, Florida in the cafeteria when we arrived. It turns out that the townspeople knew about our tragedy but refused to believe us. I responded in an angry and anxious manner and then I woke up.",college-m.tsv,,0.37301213,-0.21129785,0.025229502,-0.08404601
055-3,"#055-3 This dream occurred on December 7. The topic was a phone call I was going to make on December 20. One of my buddies from Maryland is getting married on December 19, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Unfortunately, I cannot attend the wedding because I will be flying down to Miami the next day from Boston. My ticket is nonrefundable and to exchange it for different destinations (i.e., Washington D.C. or Virginia Beach) would have cost a fortune. Anyway, my friend called me up about four days ago wanting to know if I were going to attend. I explained to him the situation and let him know that there was a ""gift"" on the way. Furthermore, I let him know that I was going to call him on December 20 from Miami. The day had arrived. It was December 20 and I forgot to call him.

However, I somehow find a way to get out of the room. I'm not quite sure how but it does me no good. Because when I get out I end up in another room exactly like the one I was just in except that it is white and not that beige color.

In some way my unconscious was trying to tell me to wake up and to study because I knew I could never let myself fail.

The weird thing was that even though I got into the bar, I had a horrible time. You see in the dream I was the only one over 21. The rest of them were only 20 and could not get in, so the roles were reversed. Basically having the dream proved to me that life is not always so good if you live by ""only if"" phrases. Because I used to say only if I was old enough when the fact of the matter was in the dream I was, but they weren't. This still was depressing for me.

215,"It was like watching a beautiful movie unfold and yet I was the main character. The somatic feelings were such that I didn't want to awaken. I didn't want to ever leave my bed. I felt warm and tingly all over. I felt so much love that I thought my heart would burst. I felt peace and safety like none I have ever felt before. I was living in another time and another culture. Yet I cannot identify either. It was a time of honor and simplicity, yet the home I lived in was very comfortable by today's standards. It almost had a feeling and look of what I imagine to be old Mexico or Spain, yet my family and I were Caucasian. I wish more than ever that I were an artist so I could sit immediately at my easel and paint the images in my mind so as to never lose them. It was nearly a year before I was to be married. The parents of both my betrothed and myself were very involved in the commitment. [Through most of the dream] I did not spend time with my betrothed. I saw him only on occasion with his father, as they came to check on me. They wanted to be sure that nothing would interfere with the marriage. My father had hired a bodyguard for me. His name was Victor. One day Victor and I were sitting at the kitchen table, each at a different side of the table, yet sitting next to each other. We were discussing life and some of the disparities in our two lives. I felt his pain as he shared with me how unaccepted he is in so many areas because of his heritage. I believe he was of Spanish decent. Victor was a tall man with bronze-colored skin. His hair was jet black and smooth as silk. His chiseled features and dark eyes were always noticed when he entered a room. I don't know if it was his appearance that got him noticed or the feel of his presence. He told me that he must be careful guarding me, as he must guard himself too. People living in my area would be happy to kill him rather than watch him roam our streets, even acting as my bodyguard. I felt so much pain and sorrow at this. Yet, he would not give up his position as my bodyguard. I rose from my chair and hugged him, cradling his head to my chest and caressing his hair. I kissed him lightly on the head. He looked up at me and I kissed him lightly on the lips. I quickly apologized. From the look in his eyes, I could not tell what he was thinking. He told me not to apologize. A few months later, I was at my bridal shower. All of my girlfriends and women relatives were there. My father was also there. I had such a warm and loving relationship with my father. I was sitting on an ottoman in front of him, with my arms stretched behind me embracing his gray and balding head as he leaned forward to cradle me in his arms and rest his chin on my shoulder. The women were playing a game. Each had a card made of colored construction paper and folded in half. The inside of each card was white with colored markings on it. Each one represented a man I had dated. One woman would read characteristics and then each of the other would mark their card if that man had those characteristics. The characteristics they read were both good and bad. I quickly made an additional card representing my father. I said I wanted to see how many of them compared to my father. Victor came and sat at the edge of the room in a rocking chair. His quiet, calm, strong presence permeated the air in the room. As always, this left me feeling unsettled, as I felt it deep in my soul. I secretly wanted to make a card for Victor. Later that evening there was a party for all of our family and friends, male and female. We were laughing and dancing. I asked Victor to dance with me. Just as I asked, the music changed to a ballad. Victor quickly agreed to dance with me. I felt the butterflies in my stomach as Victor took my hand and wrapped his arm gently around my waist, pulling me close, but not too. Our dancing in rhythm was effortless, as though we had been life-long dance partners. I could feel that we both wanted nothing more than to be closer and to gaze into each other's eyes. We dared not say anything for fear the other would say they did not feel the same thing. We dared not, for fear others would notice. I finally gave in ever so slightly, when I rested my head on his chest as we continued to dance. Weeks later, my family and friends were outdoors playing in the swimming pool. They had placed a cover over the pool so you could walk and run on it with only a few inches of water on top. They also had something spraying water into the air and people were running about in the spraying water and atop the pool. Even my father was joining in the fun. I was standing near the back by a stone wall, under a tree, with Victor. He was so enjoying watching the fun, envious because he had never experienced a family such as this. I was trying to encourage him to join us. For the first time, in the shadows of the tree, he made his feelings for me known. He ever so gently touched my breast, as if by accident, but I knew it was not an accident. I asked him if he did not want to be with me as much as I wanted to be with him. I could see the affirmation in his eyes. Yet, I was betrothed to another and Victor was employed by my father to be my bodyguard. He dared not say the words. A short time later, my betrothed and his father and two other men drove into the courtyard. They were in a car that reminded me of something a mobster would drive. They exchanged words with my father, warning that nothing should interfere with the wedding, which was scheduled for the next day. I was standing at a laptop computer, sitting on a pedestal. I was playing some kind of games that tested your mind. A woman, related to my betrothed came up and started poking fun and trying to make me miss the answers. I realized at that point that I could not go through with this marriage. I walked up an iron, circular staircase with another woman. I don't know if it was a sister or a friend. The staircase led to a veranda. My mother was already there, laying on an upholstered chaise lounge. She immediately called for my father to join us. When my father arrived, he said he was going to call off the wedding because he had just learned that my betrothed had been unfaithful to me. I was overjoyed. I sat by my mother on the chaise lounge. She had covered herself with a beautiful red silk shawl. As I gently leaned on my mother's side, I cautiously told them of my feelings for Victor and that I believed he felt the same, but was unwilling to say so because of his position. My father was overjoyed at the prospect of a union between Victor and myself. I say my mother's support and approval in her eyes. He called for Victor. After a brief conversation, he asked Victor if he would like to take my hand in marriage. Before Victor had a chance to respond, he said that it would bring him great joy to witness such a union. Victor said, he too, would be honored and overjoyed. My father said the wedding would go ahead as planned, with one exception. The groom would be Victor. Once alone with Victor we were able to finally express our feelings for each other, and our joy at our upcoming marriage. We recognized the beauty of our first night together being on our wedding night.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-04-23),0.1036684,-0.2918064,-0.24147749,-0.35663632

When we got back together from the break, I noticed how elaborate some of the drawings were. I had forgotten to tell them to draw a circle first, yet many of them had done that and drawn the symbols in the circle. I started to give them the rest of the instructions, but they wanted us all to hold hands and walk in a circle while I was doing this. I stayed outside the circle while they did it.

You could just see their horns and ears sticking out of the water. We were holding hands and wading through the water. I wasn't afraid at all. I think we were in Africa. We were outdoors. Suddenly there were snakes everywhere. At first, I wasn't afraid, but I was avoiding them. Someone was shooting at them and killing them. I suddenly realized that I had this huge snake on my back but it looked more like an octopus. Then I got scared and started jerking. I think I was trying to either shake it off or just got scared and had an involuntary muscle reaction. The person that was shooting kept telling me to turn a little bit so he could get a clear shot at the snake. I was too scared to move yet I kept jerking. We were still outdoors and close to my home.

But I just; we just soared down this winding path of stones. We ended up at this place where they were taping a soap opera. I think it was, the one with Rick and Phillip in it -Guiding Light I think.

Some of us were still on our bikes. three of us. It seems that there was another woman with us too. We were riding trying to get away. The scenery kept changing like magically and becoming dangerous. We just kept riding through it and as it we did the scenery kept changing and because we kept going and didn't let it stop us it finally went back to normal. The next thing I know we were at an airport. Rick and I and Phillip and I don't remember if there was anyone else with us or not. We put all of our luggage on these conveyor belts. This one man was checking our luggage and he asked for our certificate. He found one in a piece of luggage. He checked it and it was okay. I realized there were several copies and only one copy was right. I told Rick There. That one in that luggage is the right one. We need to make sure we have our hands on it so nothing happens to it. So he grabbed that piece of luggage and tried to find it but he couldn't. We were running out of time and he finally grabbed it off the conveyor belt and tried to find it. While he was doing that I went ahead with Philip and Phillip was way ahead of me. And I said Oh yeah, I remember we talked about this in counseling. That he is like this and doesn't mean to be rude and it doesn't mean that he doesn't care or anything just because he is way ahead. not considering me being way behind. So I went ahead. The only other thing I remember is that it all worked out okay.

255,"I was driving through my mother's hometown. I wondered if I was dreaming and said to myself No, I know I'm not dreaming right now! I was driving into or through a church parking lot and it was as though there were several weddings going on. There were many people and I saw several women dressed as brides. I was trying not to hit anyone as I drove through. The next thing I remember is that I was on roller blades and I was going around my mother's hometown High School. I don't remember now what I was looking for. I went around the back of the school and kept going into these woods. There was snow on the ground now and I kept roller-blading. I noticed prints in the snow and realized that there were wild animals around. At first I thought it was a wolf and then I noticed a white bear. I pulled some type of cord down from above and distracted the bear with that cord. He started chewing on it so I moved it in a direction that I could get away from him. I headed back where I came from. I passed another white bear but he didn't come after me. Now I was back at the school parking lot. I crossed the front of the school and went in to ask for directions to where I was going. Jennifer F was in there with some friends. I sat down with them. She told me she knew how to take blood pressures now. I told her she could practice on me. First she started feeling around on the side of my hand. I told her she had to find a nerve, and pointed one out on my inner wrist. This is odd because I would have been taking a pulse not a blood pressure. She cut a slit in the skin of the second finger on my right hand and slid her finger on the skin and pressed on a nerve to find it. I jerked my hand away and told her she was hurting me. She tried again and I did the same thing. I finally told her that she needs to do it on the outside of the skin not inside. I went back outside and headed somewhere else. I think I was headed to Aunt H's again. I got lost and asked someone for directions to Dair Ave. Somewhere along the way Bev joined me. We were laughing about how well we were roller-blading. I was able to jump up on sidewalks and jump from sidewalk to sidewalk across driveways. I counted eleven in a row once that I jumped. We were standing and talking to someone about not having learned how to stop yet we were both stopped and I was trying to figure out how to explain that. I found my way to Dair Ave. I recognized that I was on the right street.  ",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-07-06),0.042963523,-0.33491346,-0.33180892,-0.029291028
273,"I was asleep in my apartment and I thought I heard noise in the next bedroom. I thought that the noise sounded like it was coming from my parent's bedroom, on the other side of my one wall. In waking life the other side of this wall is the neighbor's apartment and my parents do not live with me. I picked up my flashlight from the floor on the left side of my bed and shined it in the doorway. I was scared to see what the noise was but shined the light there to look anyway. I was shaking and very frightened. Finally, my parents entered the room. Just after they did though I realized they were a kind of apparition. They floated into my room and fell on me in the bed. Just as they did was when I realized it was an apparition of some type. It startled/scared me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-08-12),0.09927382,-0.21689832,-0.34577328,0.092193104
313,"I was so excited during this dream as I realized that I was lucid and was sharing this with my family. They didn't know quite what to think. Many of my siblings and in-laws were there with their children. But the children were much younger and not in the same chronological age order, or not represented as such by size, than in waking life. The first time I realized that I was lucid is when Chris A was just a baby and Matthew was about three times his size. I said, Hey, you men this is a dream! They all looked at me kind of funny, not quite sure how to respond. I said you can tell because look at the difference in sizes between Chris A and Matthew. Chris A is significantly older than Matthew is and it should be the other way around. I don't know if we are all having this dream or if it is simply that I am lucid, but this is definitely a lucid dream. We went about what we were doing, changing diapers, working in the kitchen, eating cookies and such. Mari Kate S had curlers in her hair and was very small. Chris A came up to me again but this time he was about 4 times the size he was earlier. I said to everyone Look, another example of this being a dream.

322,"I was with Mike M, but he did not look like he does in waking life. He was taller, a bit younger looking and very attractive. We were practically running through a mall because it was almost time for a movie to start. We were going to see K-Pax. He had my hand and was practically pulling me along telling me to hurry. I finally let go of his hand and let him go on ahead. I think we made it in time though I don't remember for sure. I was with Mike M again but this time he looked different. We were at my home but it looked like my birth home. At some point I had woken up, in the dream not from the dream, and realized that he had moved in with me while I was sleeping. He was concerned about me because of my life situation lately and how I have been feeling as a result, particularly that I have been sleeping too much. He came in and sat on the bed by my side and was trying to help me wake up and encouraging me to get out of bed. I got up and headed for the bathroom. He had gone shopping and bought tons of stuff that was sitting everywhere. There was barely a path to walk through the house and patio. There was a lot of frozen food that I wondered why he hadn't put it in a freezer but realized it would never fit in my small freezer. I don't even know what all of the other stuff was. There were some decorative items and some kitchenware. I went outside and many of my relatives on my mother's side of the family were there. I know Larry K, Bruce W, and Sue K were there, they were making comments about Mike M and all of these things that he purchased. BJ came up to me and offered me some yellow gum. It was a small roll and she broke a piece off and gave it to me. She said Mike M had given it to her for her breath. I felt bad and apologized but told her that he had a lot of very fine qualities and that he truly is a wonderful man.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-11-04),0.07234873,-0.36374283,-0.24726336,-0.24872346
341,"Someone had broken into my house. I was wondering if I was dreaming or awake. I thought that I usually only have these dreams when I don't set my house alarm before going to bed and I know I set it last night. But then if I'm dreaming I want to wake myself up and I couldn't. So I was frustrated with myself. I also thought if I'm dreaming and lucid why can't I change what is happening. I could see my front door from my bedroom door, which I can't in waking life. This did not occur to me. I was trying to close and lock my bedroom door very quietly. I was peering out and could see that my front door was partially open. I didn't know if someone had come in and left or if someone was still in the house. I didn't know if it was just maintenance men or someone who had broken in. I went ahead and locked it and hoped that they either wouldn't come upstairs and try to get in or that if they saw that door that maybe they would just leave but they didn't. my bedroom door was right across from the end of my bed. I heard them come up and try the door so I leveraged myself against the door with my feet against the bed hoping to keep them from getting in. I heard them take out the tools and remove the pins in the door. They shouldn't be able to do this from the outside in waking life because the pins are on the inside of the room. But they did remove them. I was being unsuccessful in keeping them out. I tried to reach the alarm pull cord but couldn't get to it. They finally got in and they said something about me not being able to get to it. They didn't hurt me. I started talking to them and trying to be very cooperative so they wouldn't get violent or hurt me. There were both men and women. They said that they had recently bought or built a new home and they were here to get things that they needed or could use in their new house. I said I was surprised that they wanted anything that I have. I went downstairs with them and they had a very large pile of my things that they were going to take with them. One of things that they had was my black everyday dishes. I asked them to let me keep those and I would give them my expensive china that I never use. I told them that it was Noritake, very elegant, and there were many more place settings, etc. so they agreed to that. I was going through these wood cabinets, kind of like an armoire, though they were built into the wall. They had many different size compartments. Some were drawers. Some had doors. Some were just open. I thought this must be a dream because I don't have these cabinets in waking life. I was looking for the china and couldn't find it. I told them the one box was an old whiskey box that would be used to ship 12 bottles. I was getting very nervous because I was afraid they would think that I was lying and didn't really have the china. I suggested that they might have found it already and not realized it. I turned around and saw it sitting in their pile and pointed it out. I told them the other box was the original box and said china on the sides of it. We found it too then.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-12-08),0.09251811,-0.37074727,-0.24122983,-0.08178638
376,"I was in the garage of a house. I went outside to look at the address to figure out where I was. I saw the number on the house was 914. The name on the street sign was Field St. I realized that I was lucid so I ran back into the house to get a piece of paper to right it down so I wouldn't forget it when I woke up. I thought this might be my next home. When I went back out to look again and make sure I had it right, as happens in dreams every time I looked at the number on the house it changed. It kept changing up from 400. I couldn't read the street sign anymore but I remembered that it was field. I wanted to find out where the house was. I found a piece of paper. At first I thought it said it was in CI, then I saw PT on the paper. As I was headed back to the garage I was noticing how nicely the property was landscaped. Near the garage door was an evergreen that was dying, however. It was as though it had vertical stripes of brown dead branches all around it. I leaned over to click off the outdoor light by the cord hanging from it. I remember thinking that I needed to get the evergreen replaced. I noticed that there were lights on inside the house, but behind the garage. I went inside and back to those rooms to see what the rooms were and why the lights were on. There were three different rooms. The first one was a laundry room. The second one had bins in the wall kind of like a post office box on the street, where you pull it open and drop the mail in. One of the bins was for mail and the other was for trash. I thought it was so cool to have a mail drop box there like that. The third room had the same kind of bins but these were for recycling. They were small narrow rooms. I left and went into the main part of the house. I was wondering around in awe, with the thought that this was going to be my future home in waking life so I was very interested in looking around. As I entered the main part of the house from the garage it had a huge open foyer with a very high ceiling. Directly in front of me was a wide staircase with banister on both sides, centered in the foyer. The stairs were carpeted, a print, maybe oriental pattern. I started up the stairs to see the other floors and a woman came in the house. I didn't know what to say to her because I didn't know who she was. She seemed to be Mexican perhaps. I thought she might be the housekeeper. I don't know how but I realized that I was the housekeeper and she was the woman of the house. She was giving herself a facial, I suppose, because she appeared to have a green facial mask on. I asked her if I could speak with her. She took me up to the first landing and sat in a chair and I sat on the floor at her feet. I asked her for her thoughts about dreams and the truth of their messages. She agreed that dreams are important and often given us factual information. I told her that I had dreamt that I was going to be living in this house. She didn't say anything. I asked her if she ever thought about having a live-in housekeeper. I said I could do that and proceeded to tell her the benefits to her of doing that. She agreed to the arrangement. I asked if I could look at the rest of the rooms in the house. The house seemed to have several stories but perhaps just 2 or 3 rooms on each floor. The house was fairly large though. When I was approaching one set of two doors, she mentioned her son who had died young. These were his rooms. I looked in one room and there was nothing in there but a bed. She was talking about his awards and accomplishments and that she hadn't touched his rooms since his death. I went to the other door. I felt as though I was going to fall off the landing but I'm not sure why. The door opened up from the floor and there was nothing in there. It didn't even seem to be a room. I was trying to clean the dirt off the door as I held it up. still afraid of losing my balance and falling off the landing. We went back downstairs. I did not see a living room or any bathrooms in the house. We went into the kitchen. Someone else was there now. Someone that I knew but I can't name them. The owner was getting something to drink. She had become a soda machine and she was spinning in circles before pouring herself something to drink. After she turned back into a person I asked her why she spun around before pouring her drink and she said she does that to mix it up before pouring. I poured myself some juice in a glass that looked like a miniature brandy snifter. I saw two little girls playing in a window, inside the house. It almost looked like an empty store window. It was carpeted and well lit but empty, except for the two little girls playing there. I learned that the owner's two sisters lived with her as well and that the two children belonged to each of them. This made me think that Matthew might be able to come and live there as well. She was scolding her sisters about something and they were all preparing for bed. Three men came in to talk to the owner. She introduced me to them. One was responsible for the house, the other for the landscape, and the third oversaw everything. I reminded myself that I should tell the landscaper about the dying evergreen. She gave me a key to the house and told me that I could move in the next day but I would need to start early and be done between 3 and 5 in the afternoon. I told her that was not a problem, as my family would want to be finished by then anyway. I was thinking that I needed to hurry home and call them so they could get there early in the morning. She pointed out to me to clean up the glasses that the others had left sitting before I went to bed. We remembered that she had not yet shown me my room. We went upstairs and she unlocked the door to my room. It was as small as a closet. Room for one twin size bed and a dresser. It did not even have a closet in it. There was an alcove in which I thought another twin size bed might fit. I asked her about doing that so Matthew could stay there as well. I think I woke up before she answered me. I was walking around outside just looking at the house. I was thinking that I wasn't that crazy about the looks of it from the outside but that it was beautiful on the inside. I also didn't like that it was only a one-car garage. The outside was red brick and had no windows that could be seen from the front or the left side. The garage was on the right side of the house. It did have interesting lines. Standing in front of the house, facing it, it sat on a corner, with the cross street on the right side of the house.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-02-16),0.1081551,-0.110027984,-0.22212508,-0.13527928
392,"I had back surgery. The cut was made from my lower back near my right side all the way up to the middle back of my neck. I was recuperating at my birth home. I don't recall if I was living there or not. I was trying to find someone place that I could be comfortable and not bored. I tried to lie on my stomach on the sofa but it wasn't comfortable. Someone suggested we open the sofa bed but I said no because that would block others from seeing the TV. I kept wanting to turn over on my back but either realized I couldn't or that I had to be very comfortable doing so. I woke up slightly as I was turning over in my own bed and still being in my dream I was very careful so as not to hurt my back. People were coming in and asking me about my surgery and I pointed out where the scar stopped and started. I went to a concert with some other people. We were going to hear the Dell's. I was concerned about being able to sit in the seats because of my back so I took my own chair with me. It was like the chairs in our training room. People were looking at me funny for bringing that chair with me, but I didn't pay much attention because I wanted to be able to be there. I sat my chair down where I had planned to listen to the concert and then left for a minute to get something. When I came back some people had moved my chair and were stretched out on the lawn where it had been. I said, wasn't this chair sitting here? They said yeah. Trying to act nonchalant and innocent. I just picked up the chair and moved their legs with the chair and put it back where I had it. After the concert was over I was standing by this chain link fence, the kind that you would see at a baseball field. I said hello to some people I recognized. Then I noticed Vince P walking towards me. He looked like he kind of wanted to avoid me. He came up to me on the other side of the fence and kind of leaned up to the fence and gave me a kiss through the fence. Very typical of Vince P. He started making excuses for not returning my calls.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-03-13),0.11147151,-0.25629985,-0.24065685,-0.07531216
393,"Mother called me at about 4:30 am. I answered but was having trouble hearing her. At first I thought she had said that Daddy died. Then I realized that she said he was in the hospital. that he had a stroke. It sounded as though the prognosis was not very good. I asked her about that. She seemed hesitant to answer me. I told her that I had been having dreams lately that something was going to happen soon. I didn't tell her that some of my dreams were waking intuitions. I've had lots of thoughts over the last months that daddy won't be around on the physical plane much longer. I am unclear if these are precognitive preparations or if they are reflections of my own thoughts and feelings. I somehow knew that I was the third of the six children that she had phoned to inform of this latest development. I was wondering about the implications of this stroke in light of his pacemaker and the fact that it is in constant action these days rather than jump starting his heart occasionally as it did when it was first implanted. I was also reflecting on his deteriorating health such as his shoulder and legs and that he can no longer have surgery because of the pacemaker. I decided that I needed to leave immediately to go down there. Matthew was still asleep and I decided to walk and let him come and get me later in the day before he headed back to school. They live an hour and a half drive away. It didn't seem to take me that long to get there. In fact, I was one of the first to arrive, even though I live the furthest away. Bill F, of course, was there. But he was the only one there. It didn't seem to be too long before the others had arrived. Mother was still at the hospital. It wasn't long before Mother arrived home, with Daddy in tow. They had released him from the hospital already saying that he was fine to come home already. We all visited for a brief time and then decided it was best for each of us to go home and let our parents get some rest. John S and Rachel S were there with Bev. They asked me about one of their girls spending some time with me. I confirmed that I have wanted both of them to come and spend the weekend. There was some discussion about Rachel S still being in diapers. She had some type of a rash or something and wasn't wearing a diaper or underwear at the time. We were all getting ready to leave. I put on my gloves and reached outside the back door to grab my boots and put them on. There was a lot of snow on the ground and it was quite cold. As John and Bev pulled away I waved at them to stop for a minute. Bev was sitting in the back with Rachel S. I asked them if they would at least drive me as far as the interstate so I would less distance to walk in the snow and cold. They questioned my request to be dropped at the interstate rather than Rt. 46, as walking on the interstate is illegal. I agreed that 46 would be better. I decided that when they stopped at the intersection I would get out there. BJ was getting ready to leave as well. I asked her if she didn't want to go through Brownsville to go home. I thought that would take some of the walking distance off as well. She said no and gave reasons for not wanting to. She didn't even ask why, or perhaps did not want to acknowledge why because she didn't want to appear harsh for saying no, given the reason that I was asking. I got in the car with Bev and John. As we drove towards the interstate there were lots of Christmas decorations all over around and in the streets. We were commenting how unusual this was for St. Joe. They obviously had invested a lot of money in these decorations. They were really quite beautiful. Some of them were in the middle of the streets with room for people to drive on either side of them. Others were lined along the streets, seeming to sit in wood shelves. Others were in the center of circles and lined around the outside of the circles as well. it seemed as though I was outside of the van because I was brushing snow off the top of the decorations. John and Bev had dropped me off but I was still inside of this massive Christmas display. It was like a maze to me and I didn't know how to get out to get where I wanted to be. I kept trying different paths but to no avail. It was like one long display with halls going off to both the right and the left at equally spaced intervals. Some of the halls were dead ends. Others led further into a maze. Still others led to the outside, though not necessarily where I wanted to be outside. Many parts of the display were mobile. the walking path was as though it was a treadmill, or people mover. in the display I saw something spinning around in front of me. I stopped to get a clearer look. It appeared as thought three people were part of this display and spinning with it. I realized that two of the people were simply forms of people but the third was an actual person. It was Bill W. I reached out to try to get his attention, although it was spinning very fast. He stopped and got off. I told him I couldn't find my way out. He offered to help me by giving me directions. I followed his directions and at times found my way out, but still not where I wanted to be. Sometimes it seemed as though the path was blocked but you were supposed to push ahead and the display items would purposefully fall like dominoes to allow you to exit. Even this did not work. when I exited is where I saw the first circular display I mentioned above. It was breathtaking. It included evergreens and poinsettias, all touched by fresh-fallen snow. I moved around the circle trying to find my way. People were supposed to place something from the previous display in the circular display. I found myself back inside the maze with Mother and Daddy. I was trying to make it easier for Daddy as I was concerned about his health. I told him that Bill W had tried to help me. I was with someone else. a woman friend. We were trying to find our way out. It was pointed out to us that there was a pattern on the path and that if we counted a certain number of patterns that we would find out way out. So, for example, once we identified the first 24 squares, we could take either the right or left path and it would lead us to the outside. We tried it and realized that it was accurate. At this point this maze seemed to be just that. something set up as a display/entertainment for the local people and they would enter specifically for that purpose. From the outside it looked like a carnival tent. I noted that they had it closely sealed off everywhere, even the ground. One of the men responsible for it said they had to do that to make sure no outside light got in and that no one could see out. My friend and I decided to go back in and try to get back out using a different pattern. This time we decided to count ovals. Unfortunately the shapes were in the form of sunglasses so we could easily identify the ovals. Still, when she followed my counting we made it back out. At some points I was feeling panicky and stressed because I couldn't get out.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-03-16),0.1372548,-0.19693613,-0.24412501,-0.260456

430,"Al H and his wife were living in the city where I live. I was at their house. I'm not sure why originally. His wife was not Diane H. They had two little girls with red hair. There were a lot of bizarre things because it was springtime, and yet the little girls were getting ready to go to school but were dressed in winter coats and hats and scarves. I was playing with them as they were waiting for the bus. All I could see was their eyes. The scarves practically covering all of their faces. I was playing with them and they were giggling and carrying on. Al H was just watching me interact with these two children. When they went to get on the bus, for some reason, they took their hats and scarves off and I saw their red hair. At some point they were paying me to do some things around their house. One of those things was planting flowers in their flowerbeds around the house. Another was to take care of getting this huge stereo system installed. I can't now remember what the third thing was. The dream progressed as I was getting these things taken care of. We were having a lot of trouble with the stereo system and getting it installed properly. First there were problems with the installation itself. I mean, just getting the units attached to the house. They were being attached outside. They did finally get everything attached but then it wasn't working. One of the neighbors from across the street. She was an older woman and had come across the street to talk to Al H's wife about it. At first Al H's wife was concerned that she was coming over to complain. So, right away she became defensive and ran out to the ward to talk to the neighbor. It turned out that the neighbor wasn't upset at all. Diane H kept saying things like, if it's ever a problem be sure you tell us. The woman kept saying, No, I'm not concerned about it. We finally got the installers out there again. There were about 15-20 men working on this thing. They had a platform built to get up to the roof level. They had on uniforms. They remind me of astronaut uniforms. They were big and puffy and had big boots. They were all over the place trying to get this stereo to work. They had lined them up along the back yard while they were working and trying to get them working. They were then supposed to put them back to wherever they were supposed to stay. Al H and Diane H were getting frustrated that it was such a hassle to get it to work. They started becoming concerned about the neighbors. They were finally ready to just leave the speakers where they were and actually they were beginning to not even care if they even got them working or not. All the men in the uniforms came trampling down from the roof and were gathering at the side of the house and by their truck. One of them was telling me something about these pieces of wood attached to the side of the house, while he was lightly hitting them, tapping them. He said, If they ever go out, if you see any other house with these on it and they don't have service either, then you know it's just been a blowout. These wood panels looked like plywood panels and they looked really ugly. No one seemed to be particularly concerned about that so I didn't worry about it either. During this process the landscaper was there and Al H was asking why the different types of flowers were all planted together. He said, well, that was your fault. They weren't planned that way. You were given the layout. We just deliver the flowers and you were supposed to plant them. That was one of my jobs. I was looking at the layout and I pointed out to the landscaper, see, you have this number here, this number here, etc. And that's exactly what you delivered to me. You delivered this many of this certain flower, and this many of that flower, etc. So that's how I thought they were supposed to be planted. She said, No you received twice that many and half were for in the back flowerbeds. I said, It doesn't say anywhere on here that they aren't planted together. I'll just dig them up and replant them. Al H agreed that I needed to do that. His house was practically right next door to WDF. I had walked over there just spending time waiting for one of the contractors or something for the house. I went into the office and it was a mess. It looked like they were moving people around. I said, Wow. I don't think I even remember my way around this place. It seems that Marcia N was there. I think I talked to her for a little while. There was someone else. They asked me if they could help me. I said, No, I used to work for Al H. They said, Oh. His office is right over there. I said, No, that's alright. I'm really just spending time waiting. I went back to the house. Marlene F was there talking about how she used to work for Al H also. She didn't in waking life. There seemed to be some kind of competition going on between her and I for Al H's affection. Al H came on to me once. I gave in and we ended up making love. Later in the day I was teasing him, being playful. He said, Geez. Back off. You really need help. I was really offended by that. I just decided that was the end of that. I wasn't going to do that again. Later he was very distraught and I was trying to comfort him about all these things going on and reassure him that everything was going to be taken care of to his satisfaction and that everything would work out okay. Al H and Marlene F and I were sitting on the sofa. Al H was in the middle but it was an odd shaped sofa, so we weren't sitting right next to each other. I was feeling envious of Marlene F so I moved over right next to Al H so he could lean back against me. I was stroking his hair and such. Marlene F reached over and was trying to stroke his arm and comfort him as well.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-17),0.031443365,-0.15556754,-0.22805005,-0.18282175
433,"I was with Ben D. We had gone out of town together to visit his brother Stanley. Apparently we had been in a relationship now for a little time at least. It was evening. We were sharing a bed, but only to sleep. He expressed his concern over his brother hearing us making love. We spent some time kissing, cuddling and being playful. It was somehow going to have a negative effect on him if his brother found out. Perhaps it would effect his inheritance or something he owned. I can't recall for sure. When he leaned in to kiss me the first time. I saw his face so clearly it was as though I was awake. I questioned if I was lucid. I thought, Wow. I see his face as though I were awake. It was a very nice feeling. I had said something to him about how much his affection for me meant to me. He smiled and said, me neither. I smiled and thought to myself that it was kind of an endearing thing that it didn't bother me that instead of returning or affirming a positive statement like that, like saying I feel the same way, he always turns it into an opposite. Instead of saying me too he says me neither. In waking life I just rolled my eyes as I tried to explain that because it is difficult to explain. This is the best I can do. I remember being surprised at how incredibly gentle and loving he was. As we lay there holding each other and kissing. He expressed his frustration at not being able to make love to me. The nice thing though is that it wasn't about the sex at all, the desire to be together or to make love wasn't about the physical at all. It was about the emotional and soul connection and the desire rooted in that to be even closer in those ways. He picked up a bottle of perfume off of the bedside table. He sprayed it into the air and didn't like the smell of it at all. I said, What? You don't like it? He said, No. That smells bad. I said, Oh. Well. That's the perfume that I've been wearing for the last ten years. He just looked at me. I said, That's okay. I'm ready for a change. You can buy me something that you like. We were also talking about his hair growing out and him shaving his head. He had really black hair. And also through the dream he kept calling me darling.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-18),0.079748966,-0.12897004,-0.34456035,-0.1801296

488,"I was either in a hotel room or a second floor apartment. Bill C was there. I think Daddy was there. I may have just been talking to him. Sister Emma was in the dream at one point. Carmen A and Alison U were in the dream at one point. I think maybe two other people from school were in the dream. but I'm not sure. I said, Look did you see that Carmen A and Alison U are here? I must have said that to someone who knows them. Alison U was pregnant. In part of this dream Sister Emma lived on the 2nd floor of this apartment building or this hotel and there was a man living right beneath her on the first floor. At one point it seems that they traded places, maybe because of Sister Emma health. So she was now living, or staying on the first floor. The man was now living on the second floor. There were metal stairs leading to the second floor. I went up the stairs and it led to a roof, I think. They had taken and put a bunch of dirt and planted some trees so you weren't limited to. Maybe so you could only access one part of the roof. I just went up there and I looked around a little bit. I looked over the edge and down to the street level. Then I went back down. I think maybe I told someone that I just wanted the exercise. Now I'm living on the first floor I guess. There was something about Alison U having a doctor's appointment. She had four suitcases full of stuff, even though it was just an overnight doctor appointment. I was helping her carry all of her stuff. I am talking to Bill C and Cole P about cell phones. There was one kind of cell phone that Bill C was using. I said, Oh, yes, I have that exact same one at home. But this is the one I carry around with me. I pulled out my current phone. Bill C and Cole P both pulled there's out and we were all comparing.

I'm trying to avoid hitting all of these vehicles. I'm expecting these emergency workers to get really angry with me. But it was almost as if no one even noticed because they were so busy taking care of the accident. I went ahead and tried to drive around the vehicles. I did drive around some of the vehicles that were parked there. I got around them. I think I backtracked. I had a very deja vu feeling to it. while I was still in the dream.

I was pretty sure that I did so I didn't think he would be able to get in. I heard someone come in the front door and come up the steps. I thought it was Matthew because I thought I heard him calling me as he came up the steps so he wouldn't startle me by popping his head in my bedroom door. I thought I had my eyes open and was watching my bedroom door to show up but he never did. I lay there for a little while and still didn't see him show up at the doorway. I fumbled for the flashlight in my bedside table. This was one of those dreams that I was very sure that I was awake. I turned on my flashlight and pointed it toward my doorway and still didn't see anyone. I decided to go into his bedroom. I shone the flashlight around his bedroom and didn't see anything. I went over to his bed and started to feel around his bed. Even with the flashlight on I couldn't see very well. I remember thinking, oh, good, there isn't anyone in the apartment.

499,"I think I was looking outside or I was looking outside through the window of a city building. We see one of the twin towers explode. not like it did in waking life. It was more like. It just exploded and pieces flew everywhere. All of us ran outside. I was just walking around outside on the cement. I was just wandering around very listless because I thought Matthew was in that building or I knew there was a good chance that he was in that building. At first a bunch of people started towards the tower, towards that area. Then other structures started being attacked and exploding, I guess. It was like it was moving towards us. Whatever was causing these explosions was moving towards us. It had caused. Like a flood. I was wandering around on the cement. I decided to just let the flood drown me because if Matthew had died I didn't want to live. I don't know if I changed my mind myself or if someone else convinced me that there was a chance that he was still alive and if there was even a chance that he was still alive I needed to try to save myself. So someone had pointed to a large building and they directed us to go in there. After we went in, we went up a few floors and someone was saying that this building was safe because it was a very new building and it had been built with new materials and new technology and whatever so that it would withstand anything. I'm getting in an elevator and going up to the very top floor. I think there were a lot of children in this building. maybe a class or maybe different classes with their teachers. They were there as part of their normal day. It seems that after I had gone to the top floor that I went to a lower floor. Maybe back up again. I don't remember it what order or why. There was some association to the daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless, the characters Jack and Phyllis. In the elevator of this building it seems that there was a problem. I don't know if I was in a relationship with Jack and someone was destroying a bunch of personal things of ours or mine, trying to separate us. There was a problem with the elevator so I was trying to climb out of the elevator and up through the shaft. It was like it was dangling. and dangling crooked, as though it didn't really fit in the shaft. The shaft was possibly a lot larger than the elevator. I was trying to climb out of the elevator onto the nearest floor above me. There was a handle inside the wall that I was trying to get my hand inside of and pull myself up. I was having a lot of trouble. I started calling for help. Someone did finally come and help me get onto that floor. In another scene I was with a bunch of people. I think we decided that we were in danger in this building so we were going to try to escape. There was one way out that someone had directed us to. Only a certain number of people got out that way safely. Then it became dangerous. So we started looking for another way. In one scene I was with a bunch of girls that were part of a band, like them and their boyfriends were part of a band. These men were asking them to do something. They didn't realize that the men were asking them to do this but at the same time they were being unfaithful. I tried to tell them and they didn't believe me. They finally decided to confront the men and ask them. The men admitted to it. So they had a little bit of a confrontation. Then the men changed their minds and decided to be faithful. I left them. When I left them they were singing one of their songs.  ",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-11-24),0.008490968,-0.23625465,-0.4072525,0.07265209
511,"I was receiving some kind of award or recognition from the town I was living in for my efforts in trying to rid the town of bad men like the ones described in the rest of the dream. I was standing on a hardwood platform. It looked like a hardwood floor in a house. I was living in a small, rundown shack. I was peering out one of the two glass panels of the front door. The panels were one on top of the other. I was sitting on the floor, peering out the bottom panel, which was a square. The top panel was a rectangle. The whole area had the same type of small wooden shacks. I was looking across the street at some people sitting on the floor looking out the bottom square of theirs. There were three people looking out of that one. I kept looking at it and at one point it seemed that I was lucid so I kept asking myself, What am I doing here? What am I doing here? This car pulled up. I realized that my husband was home and was yelling. I knew that I needed to run away. I started to run. I was having trouble getting away so I started to fly. I couldn't fly fast and I couldn't get very high off the ground. I was just high enough that he couldn't reach me. He kept throwing a knife at me and fortunately he kept missing me. He kept trying to throw it different ways but kept missing me. I kept trying to get away. I had led them, he was with another man now, over a rut in the dirt. It was very muddy. They slipped and fell into it. It was a rattlesnake pit. They were getting bitten and I thought they were dying. They somehow managed to get out alive and continued to chase me. I had gotten myself back into one of these shacks. I felt as though I was moving in slow motion. I couldn't do anything quickly. I tried to go into one room and slam the door shut and lock it. But I couldn't move quickly at all. I had finally gotten one door shut. I still couldn't move fast enough to get it locked. It was as though I was moving in slow motion. I finally managed to get out. I came across a nun. I asked her what she was doing there and she said she was there to help me get away. She was directing me to do different things, but I still couldn't move fast at all. I was doing different things trying to trip them up and deter them but I couldn't believe that the snakes hadn't killed them. They were at least moving slower because of the snakebites. We were in one room and he was leaning with his back by this window. He didn't have a shirt on. I managed to pick up a piece of furniture and push it against him. I lifted it up and pushed him out the window. He fell headfirst into a lake. I thought he was sick enough from the snakebites that he wouldn't be able to survive. I thought he would drown. I did the same thing with the other man. I heard him say, sh. Just act as though we're drowning then we'll surprise her. I told the nun that they were pretending to drown. I continued to try to get away. I was lucid again at this point and said, I have got to wake up. I did.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-01-12),0.08780334,-0.3372893,-0.26446858,-0.013153036

533,"Regan K invited me to come to the UM to teach one single class/one single session, on dreams. I was really excited to do this through most of the dream. Regan K was actually Ben D. I went to the UM and taught class. I was very anxious about it going well, about doing well. At the end of the class I was asking someone to tell me when the class was over. Someone from the school had come in, maybe to make some announcements. I told them they had ten more minutes to study and then I would give them a 30-minute test. Then we would have 5 minutes of announcements. When they finished their tests I told them they could leave it on their desks and I would come around and pick them up after everyone left. Some people left their test lying under their coat, or in their coat, or on their coat, or had it sitting with their coat. They had all left and left their coats. I went around and picked up the tests. I was packing up and Ben D came in. I told him that I was a little anxious about how it went, especially being that it was his class. I care what he thinks. He walked me out and held out his arms to give me a hug, and then we kissed each other on the cheek. I walked away and started to my car. I thought, oh, that wasn't Ben D at all. That was Regan K. I was thinking about the fact that he had reached out his arms to hug me and that we kissed each other on the cheek. I thought that was nice. I was disappointed that he morphed into Regan K. I was on my way back to the office I think. This one road was very narrow. It was covered with snow and there was a high bank on either side. The weather was very bad. It was snow and ice. Cars were coming and I could see that there was only room for one car. I pulled over as much as possible and stop to allow the other cars to pass. I saw this other car coming up behind me. I wondered if they would slow down and pull over as well. I was concerned that they would hit me because they seemed to be driving too fast for the road conditions and they didn't seem to be slowing down. At first they stopped and then they started around me, into this other section of the road. Then they saw why I had pulled over so they backed up and pulled off. Twice they did this. Finally they let me go first. I got to a place where there was something like an avalanche. The snow had fallen down in and had just completely blocked the road. Now I wasn't in a car. The snow had completely enveloped me from the waist down. This other car was buried and I was very concerned about them. Part of me said something to insinuate that this is what they get for their bad driving. I was pushing on the one bank in front of me to use it as leverage to pull myself out. Then I got far enough that I could grab a small tree branch. As I was doing this I realized that the woman in the car behind was able to get out of the car part of the way so she was only waist high in the snow. She had her cell phone and was calling for help. In the meantime I was pulling myself out and headed to the office. I went back and Bruce U, the maintenance man, was working. At one place some other maintenance men were working. I had to get down and kind of get down on my stomach and shimmy through this hole in the wall to get into this one part of the building. Then I came to another place that was the same way. Bruce U was working. I didn't want to have to do that again. I asked Bruce U if I could just get in that way. He said yes and moved something so I could just walk in. I think some of my family was there. Daddy was there and Uncle H. I think Larry K and some others. We had talked about something but I don't remember what. I walked away and then I came back. I asked someone how far the UM is from here. Even though I had just driven it I didn't know how far it was. I thought that maybe it was just an hour. Uncle H and someone else seemed to agree that it was four hours. I said, Well, I thought maybe Mother and Daddy could go to this graduation. They couldn't go to the first two. I thought that maybe they could go to one out of three. But I guess not. Then I thought, It just isn't that important anyway. Because I was going to be there teaching for four hours, Ben D enrolled me in some kind of teachers association. After I finished teaching he told me this and I found out also that I was going to get paid. I was very excited about both of these things.

Cars from the street parallel to me kept turning into the lane that I was in. I had to keep getting over to avoid a front-end collision. One car finally ended up getting into a front-end collision because as I pulled over the car that was behind me sped forward and just ended up in the front end collision with the car that had turned into this on-coming traffic. I went ahead and got around them to get out of the way of the scene of the accident. But there was a school bus there that had pulled off to the side and was getting a tire repaired. So I had to get back over to the left then. Then I barely squeezed through between the bus and the car to my left without causing an accident myself. Then there was another, I think maybe it was a semi-trailer truck. I'm not sure what he was doing maybe making a turn. I was just barely able to squeeze by him to the left again without getting into an accident in between the truck and the vehicle to my left. Then there was one more time that I knew if I didn't really step on the gas and hit it I wasn't going to make it that time. I did just barely. Then for some reason I am walking. I am running, taking shortcuts through alleys and things. I end up in this really bad apartment complex. I hear police officers yelling. I think they are trying to arrest a drug dealer. I am very afraid of getting shot. I don't know where to go because I feel that I see young men running out of the apartment and yelling at each other and I feel like I'm surrounded and I don't know where to go. I finally dart to my left and see a subdivision of homes so I run over that way. It's just starting to get dark, like early dusk. I see these families setting up lawn chairs and stuff in the street. At first I wonder what is going on and then I realize that it is the weekend of the radio station's annual fireworks show. They are usually held on the bank of a river and synchronized to music. It's a really wonderful show. I finally decided to stop and ask someone the best way I told them that I'm trying to get home. I told them about getting caught in that apartment complex. One woman suggested she walk with me a little bit. She took me to this amusement park. They have a ride here. If you just get on this ride and stay on it to the end you'll almost be where you want to go. It was kind of like an alligator ride on water. You just grabbed one that had yellow on it. They were floating on the water and they had a pole coming up the middle to hold on to as you stood on it and floated along the river. During the ride people would get off at various points along the way. But the woman had told me to stay on it until the end and the man who was charge of the ride nodded yes to indicate that was fine with him. As soon as one with yellow came by she pulled it close enough that I could step onto it. I thanked her and nodded to him to indicate a thank you. I stayed on it to the end and so did he. Then there were four or five men, kind of young men, who agreed to take me the rest of the way. I don't know if it was in a car or not. I don't know why I would let them or why they went with me the rest of the way. When we got to my house there were a lot of people there. One of the five men was from another country or spoke a foreign language. I think he was just visiting the U.S. I wasn't able to communicate with him very well. He wanted to wash his hands so he was in the bathroom but he kept grabbing the wrong things. He grabbed a bottle of lotion and I said, No. That's lotion. Then I realized that he couldn't understand me. So I physically showed him. I squirted some soap onto my hands and then washed my hands. He then picked up the soap bottle and it just came out on his hands. I said, Here now rub them together. Again, I realized he couldn't understand me so I was showing him by action. Then there were these other two men. One was dark-skinned, maybe just a dark tan. I think he was American. The other was a pretty average looking man. They were saying they didn't want to leave and were very subtly flirting with me. Nothing crude or offensive. They were laying on my bed. I climbed up on my bed. I gave a very light kiss on the cheek to the one with the dark skin. I thanked him for helping me. They both got up and said they really had to go. The dark-skinned man left the room but the other one stayed behind. He was chewing on a straw. I kept pulling it out of his mouth, kind of jokingly but it was annoying to me. The last time I pulled it out of his mouth I gave him a kiss on the lips and thanked him for helping me. There was obviously some attraction there. Because after the first light kiss to just say thank you, then we kissed again and that one was a bit longer. I could tell he was very attracted to me. It was mutual. We both knew he had to go because his friends were waiting for him. We started walking out. We stopped again in a little hallway. This wasn't my waking life home. We stopped in this little hallway and kissed again. He said, I want to make love to you so badly. I just smiled at him. We walked out into the main part of the house. BJ and Bill F are both there. There are others but I don't remember who. Now it isn't my home. BJ was waiting for those men to take me home because they were also going to stop by a drugstore so I could get some corn pads for her. As we were getting ready to leave I asked her how she was going to get them. I asked her if she was going to give me time to get home and then come and meet me there and then come back here or were you hoping that I would come back here. She just looked at me with a half smile and I knew she wanted me to come back and I did not want to come back. For whatever reason I was really tired and I just wanted to go home. Then I said, I know. Bill F you have a vehicle here right? He said he did. So I asked BJ why she didn't just ask him to run him to the drugstore that is very close by and you can get what you need.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-09-02),0.14114165,-0.31762627,-0.19560862,0.009829565
679,"This dream seemed to be about redecorating two rooms in two separate houses belonging to twins in their early twenties. They both owned a dog that came from the same litter. They wanted the rooms done exactly the same because of the dogs being so much the same. I don't know if these can be twins. There was some problem that they kept running into or that the decorator kept running into over and over. There was a man that looked like this man named ""Ziggy"" that was on a decorating show that I saw in waking life. He came and made some kind of large donation to a charitable organization. Someone else did the same. There was also something about two or three flowers stands like I have on my front porch in waking life.

730,"There were three couples and I have no idea who they were. One of the couples was engaged. The other couple was about to become engaged. By the end of the dream all three couples were engaged. For either one or two of the couples there was some suspicion, I think from the woman, that her mate was either not truly committed to their relationship or maybe he was seeing being unfaithful. That may be why they became engaged - so he/they could prove to their partners that they were committed.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-27),0.39256045,-0.009142147,0.09490439,-0.22016676
747,"I went Christmas shopping. The weather was pretty bad. It was snowing with low visibility. I thought it was a good day to go shopping because not too many people would be out. I was also getting my car worked on. I went to Glenview Mall. I was looking for a ramp that you drive down to get to a certain parking area or certain stores - I'm not sure which. It's not like this in waking life. While I was out I ran into somebody I knew. It seems that maybe it was Margaret L but it didn't look like her. It was a rather thin woman with black hair. I knew her in the dream and it seems that I knew her in waking life but I'm not sure. I talked to her outside, sitting in separate cars. I guess we pulled up next to each other from opposite directions so both driver sides of the cars were next to each other. I think I realized that there was more than one ramp to use for what I was looking for. It seemed that more than once that I was driving looking for that ramp. I also at one point saw Jody S and Jason S S, I know Jason S S for sure. He was one of the people I was shopping for. I asked him about his shirt size. He said 18 neck. He said 18 and a half sleeve too but he said I didn't have to worry about that because that's hard to find. I told him if he gets more than one flannel shirt or more than one (maybe colored Tees) that it wouldn't be a big deal because he can always use more than one. Then I said, Right? He smiled and said yes.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-12-14),0.025482414,-0.20931229,-0.26523077,-0.17705949
763,"I and some family members were standing outside a home. I was standing outside a car. I think Aunt P and Aunt H were in the car. Someone was shooting at me. I think there may have been other family members in the car as well. I think later in the same dream we were in the house. Maybe it was a Harris reunion. A lot of people were spending the night. I'm not sure where we were. I think we were at my house. Alan K and Jean K were going to share my bed. Jean K was going to sleep in the middle. At one point I woke up in the dream and - that was when I woke up from this dream where someone had been shooting at me. When I woke up Jean K was awake. I said something to her. She was telling me that she had just had a dream in which either someone was shooting at me or she was shooting at me. I said, Oh. You've got to be kidding. I just had a dream that you were in that someone was shooting at me and that Aunt P and Aunt H were in the car I think. There was also something about Linda W and Dick W but I don't know what. We were going back to sleep but now Alan K was sleeping in the middle instead of Jean K. I was trying to get comfortable. They had moved so that I was right on the edge of the bed. I moved as much as I could but finally told them that I was about to fall off the edge of the bed. Jean K said to Alan K, Alan K. She's about to fall off the edge of the bed. But they didn't move. I tried to push against them to get them to move but they still wouldn't. I think Jean K got up now. I pushed against Alan K again and said, You have got to move over! I think he finally did move over. Then Larry K came in. He was alone. He was talking to us a little bit. He took his shirt off and was going to get in bed with us. I said, Oh no. I am not sleeping between the two of you. I'll get squished. Larry still got in bed on the other side of me. I said, I guess I'll sleep on top of the two of you because I'm not sleeping between you. So I was lying kind of on top of the two of them. They were both lying on their left sides. I think I was mostly lying on Larry K's back. I was noticing how much hair they both had on their backs. I usually think that is kind of gross but for some reason theirs didn't bother me that much. Maybe because it was lighter or not that thick. It was kind of curly. There was something about when Jean K told me she had that dream about it being the third time.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-01-11),0.28356323,-0.3706303,-0.025055446,-0.1680305
765,"Matthew and I were living in the condo. He seemed to be his current age yet he also seemed to be living at home rather than away at college. I was sleeping upstairs in the loft. I was frightened but I'm not sure why. Then I heard this loud noise downstairs. I got up the courage to go the railing. I leaned over the railing a bit and tried to call out for Darren. I thought to myself that this was typical of a dream - that I wanted to call out when frightened but couldn't. After a couple of tries I was finally able to say, Darren, is that you? He answered and said that it was. I went downstairs and said something to him about scaring me like that, especially when I was already scared. Now I was sleeping downstairs on a sofa. I got up to use the bathroom. There was a half bath on the first floor under the loft. I opened the door and saw how close the toilet was to the door. The toilet and the sink were sitting side-by-side and the front edge of the toilet was just inches from the bathroom door. I said I had forgotten how tight the space was in the bathroom and decided to go upstairs and use that bathroom. I went through the master bedroom to go into that bathroom. While I was using it Matthew came in the other door and got something and left again. He noticed I was in there but didn't seem to notice that I was using the toilet. He came in again and this time I had something to him like, ahem, Matthew? Some privacy here? He just kind of half-grinned, apologized, and left. After I was done using the toilet I went out into the master bedroom again. It was full of Darren's stuff. It seems that he stayed there occasionally and I was allowing him to have that bedroom as his for the times when he stayed there. Maybe it was to somewhat compensate for my ending our marriage. I was looking at the mess though. His bed was unmade. He had boxes and piles of clothes and stuff everywhere. You could hardly walk in there. I noticed that he still had the dresser from the bedroom set we bought when we got married. But then I realized that he had several low and tall dressers in there. I was thinking that I was going to switch with him and take the master bedroom back. I was wondering if I could get Matthew to help with that move sometime soon. It seemed ridiculous for him to have the master bedroom when he is only there now and then and for me to be sleeping on a sofa downstairs when I live there. I wasn't sure how Darren was going to take it.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-01-13),0.05648881,-0.381736,-0.31087548,-0.035426516
767,"I was on a trip related to SDI. I was rooming with a woman much younger than I. One morning she woke me up sitting on the floor next to my side of the bed. She was making unwelcome sexual advances. I wanted to be kind in how I handled it but yet wanted her to be very clear that this was unwelcome. I was lying on my back and she her head was resting on top of me, and one arm kind of draped across me, from my left side. I was going to try to move a bit to my left and place my right hand on her hair, hoping to indicate more gentleness as I spoke to her but found myself unable to move - as happens sometimes in dreams. Because I was not responding to her she climbed up onto the bed and lay on top of me, but she was on her side, in a fetal position, and kind of perpendicular to me. I then was able to move my arms and I cradled her while I told her that I was not interested in this type of relationship with her and that it made me very uncomfortable. I later called the BE Retreat Center to speak with Sister Rachel about withdrawing from the program and this was one of the reasons why. I am at the BE Retreat Center and trying to get in to talk with Sister Rachel about this. When I do get in to see her and begin to explain why I am there she said, You want to talk to me about this? She then said something about the fact that while she is getting settled in her new position members of the SDI are to speak with a Sister Roseanne about such matters. For some reason I thought she was going to tell me that I needed to talk to Sister Betty. I didn't know who Sister Roseanne was but felt strongly enough that I needed to speak with someone that I decided to go ahead and speak with her about it. It seems that I did go in and speak with her but I can't recall any of that now.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-01-14),0.094078146,-0.3623937,-0.2826343,-0.25250646
