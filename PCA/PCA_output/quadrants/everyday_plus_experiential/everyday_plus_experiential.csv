058-2,"#058-2 I went to the music store that I always go to in Wilmington. This time though, it looked much different. It looked like a sporting goods store I had been in years ago, which had a wooden, cabin-like exterior. The proprietor, who is one of the nicest guys I've ever met, was there, but I don't know if we talked. He was busy with some paperwork behind the desk. Meanwhile, I was going through a large selection of sheet music, which was in plain cardboard boxes. Also in the boxes were some pieces of cake and some other things like muffins and cookies. I had a piece or two, but started eating them secretly so the guy wouldn't see me. They didn't taste that good.",college-m.tsv,,-0.11768002,0.12663218
085-2,"#085-2 I was being accused of stealing my roommate's things from his room. An undercover cop came by and went into my top drawer and pulled the missing shirt from my drawer. He warned me but said we'd make a deal. He left and stuff from my roommate's room was winding up in my room. She eventually found out. However, she said she knew it wasn't me.",college-m.tsv,,-0.07989839,0.054543786
1,"After he left, another young man came out from behind the reception desk. I told him I was waiting for Debbie Phillips [unknown in waking life] . He said, oh yeah you have some forms to fill out. At that point I felt like I was a new employee. I don't know why I thought that. He walked away and I was just kind of wandering around the front office area there. There was an antique sewing machine there. Very similar to mine only I remember thinking how large it was and how I guess this interested in it. I remember thinking how much I like antiques. There was no name on it. It didn't have the make of the sewing machine like mine has on it. I don't remember seeing the pedal at the floor, but I walked around the front and pulled some of the drawers open. There were papers and stuff in there. At that point, the second young man came back out. I said, sorry, I'm just really interested in antiques. I have an antique sewing machine, but this one is larger and I was somewhat intrigued by it. He said, oh, that's okay.",elizabeth.tsv,(????-??-??),-0.14441095,0.14987305
2,"I was still living on Lakeland Dr. It was winter and snowing. There were a couple of inches on the ground. It was night and I had to distribute the mail to everyone on our street. As I was sorting out the mail for one home. A young man, about 25-30 years old, asked if he could help. I said no but he insisted. Shortly after Connie B and one of her kids joined us. We had some difficulty sorting the mail and had a discussion about one piece that belonged to me.",elizabeth.tsv,(1991-01-31),-0.15245439,0.052267656
4,"I went to visit Tim W at WDF. When I arrived, they had made many changes including how to get in. I had to enter one side of the building, climb up and across a wall that had many tools hanging on it. It was a big empty room and there were two men receiving tennis lessons. As I finally made it halfway across the wall, one of the men showed me an easier way to get to the entrance. I went up two flights of stairs and entered the door. It brought me into the company breakroom. I noticed a group of people at one table that included Freda L, Jeff L, and Susan J. They didn't even say hello. I tried to sit down with them and someone made a comment about me taking up too much room. I got up to leave. Then Susan J asked what was wrong. I said no one even said hello. She got up to go with me. She took me on a tour of the new plant. Her area was a special project she was experimenting with. It involved raising African Violets and using the petals to create dyes for fabrics. I then went on without her as she started watering her plants. In the next part of the plant they were showing me how they were testing this dye to create prints on fabrics. One of the people painting was the attorney who shops at NTNS. Now they're using these dyes and this process on people's hair. I was very frustrated with how they were doing it. It was all I could do to keep from saying something. Then they convinced me to let them do my hair. I finally spotted Tim W but he was with his boss. I realized I wouldn't be able to talk with him. As I left, I went back thru the employee breakroom and was spotted by Marcia N. I didn't especially want to see her. She came up to me and spoke briefly. It was much easier getting out of the building than it was getting in.",elizabeth.tsv,(1991-02-02),-0.27372116,0.018945713
5,"I was asking someone to do the remodel at the store. I was worried that if the committee followed my advice and went with the lowest quote that they wouldn't work out. It turned out to include Cliff S and Don St. I kept reassuring the committee that it was going to be great because I know these men. I told the men that my job and reputation were riding on this and the work had to be good. I kept remembering when Cliff S and I had a crush on each other in the eighth grade. The building they were remodeling was now a church. We started the work without approval. When the committee came by, they thought it looked great. The carpet went clear up the walls in some places. In one place, they had a huge multi-level flower cut into the carpet. It looked great.",elizabeth.tsv,(1992-??-??),-0.20706628,0.15047584
6,"I was the owner of a new restaurant. I was going around to the tables asking the patrons if everything was okay. At one table were two men. I sat down with some friends at a nearby table and could overhear their conversation. One asked the other what he thought of me and his answer was, ""Magnificent."" When they got up to leave, he came by our table to say thank you and shake my hand. After shaking my hand, he held it for a few seconds. I was having trouble with some of the employees not getting along with each other. They wanted to quit because of that and/or because of changes at the restaurant. Through conversations, they all convinced themselves to stay. There was some problem with the customers. We were serving too slowly.

13,"I was working for NTNS but we were in a huge warehouse. I had been cleaning up and organizing. I found some racks with children's clothing so I rolled them over to the children's section intending to transfer them later. When I went back to do it, Darren was there doing it. I went on cleaning up. I was finding lots of racks with wheels that we didn't know we had. I ran into a stock boy also cleaning up, moving things, and throwing things away. We had a discussion about why they had saved all this stuff. I was then approached by one of the committee chairs about a problem. It seems someone had given two families a very large amount of clothing free and used my name. I tried to tell her I didn't do it. I finally found out that Darren and Angie Ho were responsible for one and a woman named Debbie [unknown in waking life] the other. Darren and Angie were operating as an independent agency helping the underprivileged. They helped themselves to our stock. They did have an office our building. Even after we told Angie Ho she couldn't do this, she continued under a disguise and alias. I finally caught her and turned her in. Also, she was posing as a government employee giving advice on raising and caring for children. I reported her as unqualified and mentioned that BJ would be great for this kind of work. The committee chair still did not believe me. We found Debbie, but it was her word against mine and the committee chair believed her. I found many different rooms on different levels, piled with boxes full of supplies, racks, etc. I also wound my way around an upstairs workroom and back out again.",elizabeth.tsv,(1993-02-28),-0.32683304,0.010139042
24,"I was with someone in a store kind of like a Kmart. I don't know who I was with but they were shopping in a different part of the store. I was looking for plastic storage containers. I wanted to see how much they were or if they were on sale. When I got to the aisle where the storage containers were they were many sale signs hanging by them on the back wall of the shelving unit. I remember seeing one that made me think they were on sale for $5 and some cents. The signs were hanging next to the containers rather than in front of or over or under the containers, as would normally be the case in a store. There were actually no products for sale under or over the signs. I remember thinking this is a great price. The containers were clear, frosted kind of look, with blue lids. They were rather large, like 5 gallon size perhaps but rectangular. I decided to look more closely at the signs and realized that all of the sale signs were for personal care products that weren't even in that aisle. They were hanging in layers on top of each other but maybe four or five across also. I thought to myself, ah, the employee who was supposed to hang these probably didn't want to do it so hung them all here just to say the job was done. I went to find a manager to tell them about it. I found a young man, though I don't know if he was a manager or not, and told him about the signs. I walked back to the location with him. When we got there, an employee had just finished filling that spot with Tampons. I get a sense that he put the tampons there but I'm not sure. The tampons were piled so high that they hid the sale signs completely. The man I brought back to show them to somehow looked behind the tampons and saw the signs. As I walked away, he was using a hammer to loosen the shelf above the tampons/containers/signs. I thought that he was doing that so he could get to the signs to remove them. The next thing I remember is that I was still in the same store but I was looking at clothing. As I was looking, I encountered a woman acquaintance. I say acquaintance because I don't know who she was. I get the sense that she was someone that I was not particularly fond of. I chatted with her a bit; she was just standing around waiting for someone she was with who was shopping. I selected a few items and went to the dressing room to try them on. As I returned from the dressing room, I went by the men's dressing rooms. They were all full. While I could not see any of the men in the room, I got the sense that one man was completely naked and I could see pubic hair, nothing else. I felt embarrassed and tried to hurry by. Some men looked at me as though they thought I worked here. I remember thinking to myself that I have spent too much time working in retail, because my past work in retail affects my shopping experiences, related to things like the sale signs. Now these men think I work here. They were trying on sports coats. I commented to both of them that they looked great. They were both black men. The one seemed very happy that I told him he looked great. He said something to the other man as I walked away. I don't know what he said. I went back to where I got the clothes I had just tried on. The woman acquaintance was still there. She was kind of leaning on a circular rack full of clothing. I approached her again; I think to put the clothes back that I had just tried on. She was standing so close to the rack that she was somewhat in between the clothes on the rack. I started talking with her again. It seems that we were talking about a mutual acquaintance. I don't really remember, except that she made some comment about alcoholism and I asked her if she was an alcoholic. She said yes. I am now walking around the store pushing a shopping cart and at the same time trying to carry a large metal ladder. I can't remember why I had the ladder. It also seems to me that there was nothing in the shopping cart. I have been called to the manager's office. When I walk in there are two male management members and one female. I remember nothing about the female. The one male did all of the talking and the other male, who seemed to be his superior kept fidgeting in his chair and turning his back to me through the whole conversation. The male who did all of the talking was the actor who used to play Judge Harry Stone on night court. He began by saying they wanted to discuss a few things with me. They handed me a list and began to go over the list. The list was typed on rather dark, brown, very heavy stock paper. I wondered to myself why they had chosen this because you could hardly read what was typed on it. The first things they discussed were very general and did not appear odd to me. I was cordial and making light, comments to evoke smiles or chuckles as the conversation began. They said they had been watching me on camera that afternoon. I think that it was at this point that I determined that they were terminating my employment. I looked at Harry and said, you are accusing me of stealing aren't you. He said, you bet we are! I realized we all had the brown pages and they were in a binder with a rather large number of other pages though the others were all white. I told him I wanted him to put that in writing, on one of the white pages. He said gladly. He and I started flipping through the white pages. It was as though he wanted to pick a certain page to write it on. I didn't care; I just wanted it in writing. I was so very angry. I had stood up at this point and was talking very loudly and angrily at him while pointing to the book and asking him to put that in writing.",elizabeth.tsv,(1999-06-12),-0.090036236,0.32628915
28,"I was a manager at a type of retail store like a Wal-Mart. I opened up some new packages of different kinds of chewing gums. In one box that I opened, there were six or eight different kinds. After I opened them, I realized that we really didn't need them at the register. I put them there anyway. I remember thinking how good they smelled. I realized that they were different from the ones that were sitting there; the ones that I thought I was going to be refilling or replacing. That's why I decided to just put them there anyway. The cashiers needed some help with some money. I went down. I thought I'd do my part. I'll work my Saturday. I'll work my shift. No extra. As part of the management team, I'll do my part. I'll work my Saturday. The next thing I know I am at GC. I'm sitting in a room in a circle with some other students and people who work there. I was thinking that I've graduated but I'm waiting to hear the assignments of who our student advisor is. Our student advisor is another student who is further along in his or her studies than we are. I'm sitting thinking that I would be one of those advisors, yet I'm sitting there waiting to here who mine is going to be. There are a few that people are really hoping to be assigned to. I'm confused as to whether I am one of those or if I am eager to get one of those people. I go to Terry K and explain to him that I am not going to be there as a student. What I will actually being doing during that time is working on the preparation work or whatever I need to do to present my dissertation idea and asked him if I really need to be there for that. He said he found the campus to be a wonderful, meditative getaway spot for him when he was doing that. He came there simply for that reason because it was such a great place to be to do that type of work. He found it very productive and beneficial. He was able to get a lot done there. I thought that made sense. I remember thinking right away about the money, how much money it would be. I would be paying $1500 for residency.",elizabeth.tsv,(1999-09-12),-0.14885306,0.09137096
35,I was being chased. There were three men working in a kitchen or hotel. It was a huge room and there were many people around. They had on chef's aprons and hats. One of them must have been the head chef. The other two did something wrong that somehow was involved in me being caught and getting away. I don't know.

43,"Doctors were doing something to alter patients minds. Noah Wyle, an actor on ER, had found out about something that some of his coworkers were doing that was very wrong. They cornered him and took him to this upstairs location kind of like a loft. They significantly injured him physically, though I don't get the sense that they beat him. It was like they had put some kind of cuffs or something around his wrists and ankles and caused severe abrasions that were about 2 inches wide all the way around on each ankle and wrist. He was bleeding a lot. Down the middle of his chest were severe abrasions. He tried to sneak down to the locker room so he could clean himself up. He was trying to hide it so know one would find out what they had done. He was doing this to protect himself because they had done this to threaten him so he wouldn't report them for what they had done. He was putting on his scrubs and he had tied a whole lot of medications for his injuries tied to a belt. He was trying to hide them under his scrubs. A nurse coming in for her shift happened to look in and saw all the medications. He was talking to someone. That person didn't notice but this nurse did. Before that, I was talking to a supervisor. I guess I worked there. She had told me to check an ad and see if some things were still on sale. I had to stand on a wall heater or something to be able to look at an ad that was posted on the wall. I don't remember what it said but I decided from looking at it that the stuff was not on sale any longer. I never did go back and tell her that. She also wanted me to put out some new things on a shelf. She instructed me that even though the boxes were very attractive that I was to take the things out of the boxes to display them. There was a section of shelves where we displayed over-the-counter medication for employees. We kept them in the boxes. She wanted to make sure that I took these out of the boxes to display them. I went by one area that there were all kinds of hair care. It was large bottles. They were all green. Doctor B came by. I didn't say anything to him. I don't remember any conversation or anything. I just had the sense that he was there. I didn't do anything with the hair care products.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-02-08),-0.07737128,0.03421955
46,I call a TV repair service to fix the TV. It took a long time but the service man showed up. After considerable time he was done and he presented the bill. It was outrageous to me. There were three items and two seemed reasonable but the third was excessive. I talked to the repair man about this. He showed me a part that seemed like a simple plug. I did not pay the bill but said I would contact the owners. I asked if labor was included and he said no.

51,"I was in a car with Bill F. He was driving. We were in SC. We were going to be moving there. We had found a condo to purchase and live in. I don't remember if we/I was going to purchase or rent. We were driving by the condo and I wanted to stop and look at it again but we decided we could on the way back from wherever we were going because we had to come back for Matthew before we left to drive back to our home state. We were headed to a meeting. When I arrived at the meeting with a female business partner, Bill F was not around. We were the two principal executives of a multi-million dollar company. It had something to do with hair salons. The place where we were meeting was a very large hair salon. Someone was showing us around and introducing us to everyone. I think my partner and I were buying the salon or taking it over. I'm not sure which. One of the women that was working there was wearing an apron. It said something like I do shampooing or some such. I said I wanted one like it, even though I wouldn't wear it. David Letterman was at the meeting. He was telling me that he had invited someone to dinner and she was very reluctant to go with him.

95,"I was at NTNS talking to Jane H and Janet S. I was speaking mostly with Jane H as usual. Jane H was pricing some things to put on the sales floor and Janet S was helping customers. I asked Jane H about her daughter's wedding. She said it is in one week. I asked how Angie Ha is doing and she said fine. I asked about her soon to be son-in-law. She told me that he is a very good guy, but some of his friends were questionable. One of them is an ex-convict. She was still sure that the son-in-law is a very good guy. She was pricing some bright yellow bath towels. I commented about them because they were so large and very thick. They were very nice. She asked if I was interested in them because she used to price things special if she knew I wanted them. I told her I needed to stick to my budget so I better not. She then asked Janet S if she was interested in them. When she held them up for Janet S to look at them they were draperies and not towels. She also told Janet S the size but I don't remember the number exactly. I think it was 13 inches or 18 inches. Janet S decided she wanted them. I decided I needed to leave. As I was on my way out the door. I told them I was on my way to a wedding. I came back in and said it was the wedding of my first of six Godchildren. They were amazed that I had six Godchildren. I noted also that it was the first of my parent's grandchildren to be married. Chuck C was standing at the register preparing to make a purchase. Just after I left the store, I realized that it wasn't the first Godchild but rather the second, thinking that Jody S was the first. I thought I should go back and correct my error but didn't. After leaving the store, I decided I wanted a straw hat for the wedding so I decided to go into this other store and look for one. I accidentally went back into NTNS but hurried back out hoping they didn't see me. When I went into the other store, she had a pile of three or four straw hats on her counter. The straw was beige and the ribbons were black. I decided to buy one even though the ribbon was the wrong color. I left the store. Outside the store, I pulled the black ribbon off and decided that I could buy some pink ribbon so it would coordinate more with my outfit. After leaving the store, I realized I didn't pay her. I ran back and apologized profusely for my oversight. She was very kind about it. I left the store again and headed for my car. The stores were downtown. I was parked under some steel bridges or some such. As I was trying to get to my car I realized a bunch of people, like a large family, were in the way. They were standing along the street and doing something to a baby. Perhaps they were just changing a diaper. The baby had no other clothes on and was very large; not just like a large baby but very large. I'm not sure how to describe it. The baby also looked like it had something all over it that gave its skin a glazed appearance. Just as I approached them, they finished what they were doing and left. I got into my car and left also. As I was driving, I was going very fast, because I realized I was running late. I ran over a curb on my left side. It was the kind that divides two-way traffic. I had to drive strangely to get back over the curb and onto the road properly. I worried that I would ruin a tire doing this but I didn't. Other cars were headed straight at me and had to drive to miss me. I think I was still on the right side of the road. I had the sense that it was the fact that I was in such a hurry that was causing the problem not that I was in a wrong lane. A van pulled cross ways in front of me and then drove up into a grassy hill to avoid being hit and then back onto the road behind me. I had the sense that they had been trying to merge with traffic and pulled out to far without there being adequate room for them to pull out properly so they had to make this maneuver to avoid being hit by me. It was their inappropriate driving that caused their situation not mine. As I continued to drive, I was thinking how much I hate driving downtown because I hate driving this route. I suddenly realized I had missed my exit. Shortly after that, the road became train tracks and I was the only one there. Instead of driving a car my vehicle was suddenly a semi-tractor with a chain of trailers. Instead of driving it, however, I was pushing it. It was full size and I was normal size yet I was pushing it as though I was a child playing with a toy truck. I was still hurrying because I knew I was especially late now that I had missed my turn and ran into this unexpected obstacle. As I continued to push the truck, it started to go underneath a train. I'm not sure how that would be possible. This lends itself to this on-going oddity of sizes. I pulled the truck back out from under the train and lifted it onto the next set of tracks. I eventually came to a tollbooth. There were several lanes and all were full so I got in line. Most of the other trucks had the drivers inside them but I was still outside and behind of mine. As it became my turn at the tollbooth, I pushed my truck through. It went rolling down the hill and into the highway. It was a regular highway again now. I was still waiting for the tollbooth agent so I could pay my toll. I was trying to keep an eye on my truck so I knew where it headed. I was wondering if I would be able to catch it. I saw it take an exit ramp. It was in the middle of quite a bit of traffic and seemed to be doing just fine without a driver. You would think a capable driver were at the wheel. While I was waiting to pay the toll, I saw another driver outside of his truck in the same situation. His truck had gone ahead without him. He was dancing around at the tollbooth trying to get the agent to hurry so he could catch his truck as well. I don't know why, but at this point I felt reassured that I would be able to catch my truck.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-06-24),-0.29323626,0.13429858
101,"There was something oddly familiar about this. I was at a meeting. I think at the hospital. I felt like I had been at this meeting before. There were several large round tables. Doctor Bl was sitting at one of those tables. I sat at another. Someone was sitting on both sides of him, though there was an empty chair at his table. We had been given manuals by the presenter to follow along. The pages were glossy and the colors were shades of beige/brown/gold. The man I was sitting next to had his book open to a different page than I did. Doctor Bl's was open to a still different page. I changed mine to the same page as Doctor Bl. The man next to me, whom I felt was superior in some way, told me that was wrong. That page said 1999-2000 goals and objectives. The man next to me finally convinced me it was the wrong page so I turned to the page he was on. I was walking outside, back to the meeting. Another woman walked up alongside me and took my hand. I asked her if we had met at this same meeting the last time. She said yes. She appeared older than me, with very full, shoulder length, straight, salt and pepper hair. I never did see her face. She was getting ready to take lunch to a group of people. It was part of, or an exercise of, this meeting. She stated that she had done it the last time and found it very rewarding. We had the option to take lunch to someone or to have a spiritual lunch by ourselves. She left and I prepared my car/mini-van to take lunch to some people. I had the car running and the AC running so it would cool off. It was a beautiful summer day. I remember how green the grass was. As I was doing this I felt excited like it was a very good think to do and that I would enjoy it. Then I saw other people sitting in the grass and eating lunch alone or in pairs. I thought maybe I should do the same. I remember thinking that I didn't know who I would take lunch to anyway.",elizabeth.tsv,(2000-07-09),-0.14172901,0.025605755

My ex-in-laws were there but it wasn't Ray H & Kay H [different people than in waking life] . I had begun to feel good about how I was doing on my own when the ex-wife shows up and tells me that he hasn't kept up with the car payments and now I have to catch them up.

Somewhere along the line, someone suggested I interview to be the store manager again. I asked about the current JLI members to see if there was anyone around who would remember me. I was inside the shop but it was jut a very small room, like a small living room. There was very little merchandise. Jane H and Janet S said that's all there was. They gave the impression that there was concern that the store might have to close. There were several colors. The one that sticks in my head is red. There were two very cool pieces of furniture. I'm not sure if they were really pieces of furniture. One of them reminded me of a miniature of Grandma F's wardrobe. The other was similar, larger, and yet different. One was marked $300 and the other $130. Jane H was marking them down and making it sound as though they should already have been marked down but I wondered if she was just doing it for me, as she often does in waking life.

I told someone, more than one person, what we were doing though I didn't actually see other people. I started moving everything out of the garage into the driveway. There were many bikes, boxes, linens not in boxes or anything, gift tins and baskets with things in them. I don't remember throwing anything away or giving anything away. I was just organizing to make things fit better. One of the baskets had many little, jewelry-sized gift-wrapped boxes in it.

131,"It was the morning of October 21, 2000. I was at this large, old house. 2-3 people showed up for the first regional conference. They had not pre-registered but rather just showed up hoping to get in. I explained to them that the event had been cancelled and I think they left but I'm not sure. The next thing I know there are 50 or more people there for the same reason. Wanting to attend but not having pre-registered. I had them all take a seat at tables. The tables were all like dining tables and set up with dinnerware for a meal. I climbed halfway up this very wide staircase to speak to the people. I said, I am vertically challenged so I'm going to stand up here to help you hear me. They all chuckled. I announced that there had been a problem with the mailing and so we had cancelled the event. Since there were so many of them there, we were going to see what we could do to accommodate them. I explained that there was no way we could get Bart H there at this late notice, but I would see if we could get Barry C on an immediate flight. I also stated that my presentation would be different since I did not have the proper AV equipment. I was thinking that I would only tell them that much although I was worrying about it because I had not finished preparing that talk. I was also trying to figure out what we were going to do about food, etc. I didn't mention anything about vendors because I knew there was nothing that could be done about that. I noted that two of the people who had signed in were people who had worked with dreams and I think I knew them. I had asked one of them if he could make a presentation to fill in the space allotted for Bart H. Somehow the other one got the message that I had asked for him. I decided that was fine. Regarding the food, at first I thought I would have to just tell them they would be on their own for lunch. A little later, I thought I about doing something simple that could be done last minute like calling Subway to deliver. That way we could still do the lunchtime dream discussion groups. I told the people who were there that I would figure out an adjusted price due to the circumstances. I thought a little more about what would be involved to get Barry C here. I thought he would surely have some money in a savings account that he could pay his expenses just until he got there and then I could reimburse him. I would have to tell him not to call Continental just to use his $100 voucher but try to find the best airfare for the time he needed. I would also tell him to just take a cab when he gets here and I would reimburse him for that as well. He might have to take a cab from his home to the CHV airport as well. I think I woke up more than once in the middle of this dream [unless I was simply lucid] thinking I can't believe that this is a dream and the event was supposed to be yesterday.

I kept finding more. When we started painting, we did just a little bit under the windowsill to see how it would look after it dried. The next morning we looked at it and it was a yellowish-beige instead of teal. I took a razor blade and started scraping off the top layer, which exposed the teal. But the teal part was somewhat wet and left it looking rough or textured rather than smooth. I said, well, we could make it work this way. Then Matthew, or perhaps someone else, found the problem and pointed it out. It says to use egg noodles and the ones we used weren't egg. I ate some of the non-egg noodles and then rinsed my mouth as though I had just brushed my teeth. I brushed them over and over again. My teeth and mouth seemed to be coated with teal paint and the water kept rinsing it out. Matthew came up and said, the water is clear now mom!

There was as bun and a hamburger on the grill. not cooking but maybe being kept warm. There were also a bunch of candy wrappers in a section attached to the grill. like the drip pan. The one I remember was an M&M wrapper. I told someone working there that you should always but two meat patties on a sandwich because it will taste much better and people will pay extra for it. I was making someone a fish sandwich so I put two pieces of fish on it. I went to look at the work schedule to see who was coming in that night. It said, Cutler. It was typed in bold black letters. He had been scheduled the previous night also. I thought it was good that he was scheduled because he's a good kid and good worker. For some reason I realized I would have to clean up the kitchen at close. That's a hard and messy job. When it was close to closing time, I took a metal piece off the ice cream syrup to wash it. I got extra syrup on it taking it out. It strung out like melted cheese. The syrup was chocolate and butterscotch. It was good.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-01-06),-0.29073742,0.010250742
157,"Matthew left for school in the morning and I began working on Christmas presents. I think I was going to wrap some. I had told him to separate the ones for us from the ones for others. The ones for us were to be around the base and front of the tree. I found some for BJ's family, I think, around the front. They had been wrapped by the store in solid color shiny paper. They had little stickers on them that said what is inside. At first, I didn't like the stickers then I decided they were okay. There was a little more room under the tree than in waking life. Several of the packages were very tall and I thought I would lay them on their sides and slide them under the tree. Matthew cam back home. He had car trouble. I went with him in my car to do something about it. While driving/riding I realized we were sitting still in the road. I brought it to Matthew's attention. He looked and realized the car was not in gear. He put it in drive and started going again. He was very distraught about having car problems again. He was thinking about that instead of his driving. We started discussing his finances to see if he had the money to pay for more repairs. I asked him if he had anything in the bank and he said no. Then I asked how much he had in the bank and he said only about $3500. I was very surprised and said, really? He said yes, shaking his head yes at the same time. I suggested that it would be okay for him to buy another used car. We went to look for one. We went to a dealership. The owner walked by us and I told him I was referred to him. I said Matthew's paternal grandmother and his mother were good friends. He looked at us as if he didn't want to be bothered because he didn't know us but I guess he decided to he should because of his mother. Don H was there also. I said, Don H, I was going to call you because I need your help. I wanted him to help Matthew find and purchase a car. We were sitting at a table with the owner and he was hassling us as if he couldn't help. Finally, Darren handed him a check for $35 and said to put him in a car. I told him to make it $75 because I don't want him paying on this forever. He said he didn't think he could do anything because he doesn't sell blue cars, meaning inexpensive or lower end. I said that I was guessing his mother is a friend of Matthew's grandmother they must be somewhat alike. She would probably expect him to help us. He was visibly upset but obviously agreed with me. He told an employee to get the cash box. I could tell he wasn't getting ready to go show us some cars. After he walked away, I realized there were two rows of tables where employees were sitting, maybe having lunch. A black man sitting at one end was sitting there laughing about our conversation. He said the owner couldn't find anything for $75 a month, but knew he would sell us something for that amount because of his mother. I gave the man a playful slap on the arm and said, don't mess with my game here. He laughed harder and nodded his head yes.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-01-17),-0.26525867,0.012751158

I don't even know who was getting married. After the wedding was over, we opened the door to let the other guests in. there wasn't really room for them because there were dining tables set up that took up the whole room. We told them it was standing room only. We had to eat in shifts. There is dancing in the room. The tables were gone. We had some chairs set up around the perimeter of the room I was trying to make as much room as I could and have seats for people. There was bunch of junk in the room. Like tables along the wall with stuff piled on them. We were dancing and having a good time but not many people would come in. I don't know why but it seems that Alan K was there because I don't remember seeing him or anything. I just have this sense that he was in it. It also seems like there were two separate wedding dreams. At another one, the room setting was very similar but I went in and Uncle H and Aunt R were sitting there eating. There was a woman and an empty seat between them. I thought that maybe she could move over one so there would be two seats together but I don't think I actually said this. It might have been this one that I remember something about the women in the wedding party. The colors were pink, white, and black. Just one of the bridesmaids had a black bow in her hair.

After the incident with Al H I thought about calling Deb U and asking her to say something to him about how inappropriate it was for him to ask me to run copies.

Twice clerks came up to me and pointed out there exercise equipment but I told them I was looking for something very specific. I think I was looking for something like the ab roller that I use at the Y. I started to walk away and I walked by this counter. There was a man and two women there. The two women were making a strawberry milkshake. I saw one put a scoop of vanilla ice cream into the blender. I said, Now that's what I'm looking for. They said, do you really want it? I said sure. But I had to find a glass to put it in. I told them to hold on a second, that I would go get my other one. I went to get it but it had chocolate all over the inside. I went to grab something else, it was a blender beaker as well, but it had chocolate in it too. I told them I would just go to the refreshment counter and get a cup from them. They said, You're going to buy one for that? I said I would if they wouldn't just give me one.

My jacket was white knit so the change in the pockets pulled it down a lot in front. Some of the change was in piles and had 50 cent pieces and silver dollars and quarters in it. I was so excited to find all this change. An elderly, gray-haired lady walked by and said something to me but I don't remember what she said.

193,"My extended family and I had gone to something like a carnival with a picnic lunch. Carnival is the closest I can come to describing it though it was indoors. All of my siblings and their children and my parents were there. When we got there, Jonathan F and I took off. We spent the day with some mobsters and some Indians. We had a really good time. The mobsters were all very nice. We sat and played checkers with them and talked with them. The Indians taught us things. They taught us to make some little tools. One was a tool to fish with. They showed us how to fish with it. When we got back to the rest of the family they had all eaten already and were almost ready to go home. Jonathan and I walked away again to get something to drink. We found some cups but we had to try several soft drink machines before we found one that worked. Then we went back to the family and started helping them load up the vehicles. Bob F had his van and the rest of us rode in the back of an open-bed truck. There was a tray that had deviled eggs and raspberry tarts on it. The tarts looked like round biscuits, cut open and stuffed with raspberry pie filling. Someone commented on how good the tarts were but that we forgot to eat them. When we were loading up they all got eaten but one. I took half of that one and someone else took the other. But when I took it, it was more like toast with raspberry pie filling on it and some little round or square things on top. It wasn't nearly as good as the others looked. I took the tray of deviled eggs out and when I got out there I realized that there was another tray of eggs too and that I should have combined them. I also realized I should have covered them with plastic wrap before I brought them out. I asked someone to hold them so I could go in and get some plastic wrap but they didn't. I thought about trying to balance them on the truck while I was wrapping them. Then I thought I should just take them back inside and wrap them but I don't remember doing that. There were also all of these trays of cookies. Everybody got everything loaded up and in the truck except me. I was going to sit in the same place that I sat going there. I had to pull out this thing and there was a plastic container for me to sit in. But someone had filled it with cookies for Bev to take to her in-laws. So, we had to take all of the cookies out. BJ said she needed to go buy tickets to a Reds game. Daddy backed the truck up to the lines where she was buying the tickets. But he almost hit some people. I was yelling at him to stop and he just barely stopped in time without hitting anyone. BJ came back out and said that there were no tickets left for the entire season. One of her kids, I think Todd A, was very upset at this. Todd A was a lot younger than in waking life. Somebody said one of the reasons they were all sold out was because of a Cobb wedding. The Cobb's had purchased every seat in the stadium. Bev said to us that it sounded like the Cobb's. Somebody else said they had some tickets to sell. They started out saying they had some $12 seats and asked if anyone was interested in those. Nobody was. Then they said they had some $15 dollar seats. Then, somebody said here's two seats for $250 each. Somebody bought those. It turned out they were Kim H's tickets that she sold. She was really excited about this. We went ahead and started leaving. Daddy was backing up the truck, but it seemed more like he was just letting it roll and not paying attention to where it was rolling or not aware that it was rolling. I yelled at him again to stop because he was about to back into things. He was about to back into a soda machine. Then he almost hit some gas tanks, and then a couple of other things. He finally stopped the truck and said, I don't know what you were yelling about. I said, because you just missed hitting all of this stuff. Daddy started driving and I was actually walking along the truck. When he came to a stoplight I leaned my back and hands against a wall to try to get into the box. Bob F and Bill F helped get my legs in. Then I pulled on Bill F to get myself in the rest of the way. Once I was in we had to put all of these cookies back in around me. Bev was telling me which ones to put where and how to put them in because there were several different kinds.  ",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-03-17),-0.0777895,0.015883008
197,"I was with some of my family and I went to visit my house on Lakeland Dr. There were priests living in it now. As I walked around, the floor plan wasn't the same as it was in waking life. But I recognized things and was enjoying going through it. I looked out the window and pointed out that they had replaced our deck with something else. The fence that they had put up was kind of gaudy. It had big, thick, black posts with horse heads on the top. It was shiny. I don't know what the material was. if it was painted wood or some kind of metal. I was looking for my refrigerator. I finally walked into one room and there were two of them and one was mine. I said to Mother there it is and we went and looked specifically at the ice and water dispenser. After we left the house I realized that I had not looked at the kitchen or family room. I am planning to open my own store. I don't know what kind of store. I asked BJ and someone else to help me make a sign. I was going to put an advertisement in the church bulletin and someplace else and I thought we could make a poster board sign that would look like a real sign and then take a picture of it for in the ad. I was thinking of the kind of wood sign that you would find hanging out from the building outside of a store. like in the movie chocolate. BJ complained at first but then agreed to help. It was going to be pink lettering on a white background. I'm not sure where we are working on this. At first I thought we had room to work on them in my parents bedroom. But we were in this very large room with several large tables. all of my CRHP sisters are there to help but we aren't at my parents house. I have a sense that we are back at the rectory but it doesn't seem at all like my house on Lakeland so I'm not sure where we were. I had started making the sign. My CRHP sisters decided what kind of signs to make without asking me and had them done really quickly. They had made one for each holiday. They used lots of different colors. They just used large white paper instead of poster board. And they got rid of my initial sign of white poster board with pink lettering. They didn't say much about why they did that. They knew that I noticed but they kind of ignored it. I know they were all there but the ones I specifically remember were Theresa Ay, Theresa S, Judy D, Linda B, and Sheila G. We talked about how to transport these to my home or store. They said we could crease them but it was better not to. If we were going to fold them over without creasing, we should fold them over with the print on the inside. They had lots of glitter on them also. They were pretty but reminded me of things children would have made. which was not what I had wanted at all. I had wanted something simulating a real sign. Some of us folded the signs over and carried them outside to put in a car to take to my home. Others just let them hang freely and carried them out. Some of them had tape on the ends as though to hang them. They had also brought with them these huge containers of cookies and sweet rolls and such. We talked a little about what kind of store I was going to open. I joked that I was going to be a chocolatier. But the more I said it the more I liked the idea. I still don't know what I was going to do. When we got done with the signs we had to do something with all of these cookies. We started dividing them up among us so we each had a selection of everything. Most of us were putting ours in these huge roasting pans the size that would be used to serve a very large party. Some of them didn't want to take very many and were putting theirs in small plastic containers. Every time I thought we were done I would fine 2-3 more pans or trays. People started leaving and there were still pans of cookies left. I think we finally ended up getting them all divided except one final pan of chocolate cookies with chocolate chips. I asked whom all the empty pans belonged to. Some of them were the tin foil pans but there were also plastic containers. Some of the plastic ones I recognized as my own. There were two plastic ones that had pull out drawers. In each drawer were two recipe boxes. I looked inside the recipe boxes and they were empty. As we were loading up our cars I mentioned that I was looking for a new place to live. Someone said this would be a good time for me to move closer to the northeast side of town since Matthew will be leaving for college. I said I agreed but then stated that I already live on the NE. I don't know why I was moving or if I was trying to buy a condo or house again or just moving into another apartment. Some of my CRHP sisters wanted to go look at it with me before I decided for sure. I said that was fine and that we would see when they were available and go then. I was asking Theresa Ay for sure. At first I thought they could meet me at work and we would go from there then I realized that was a lot of extra driving for them so I would just give them the address and directions and meet them there.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-03-20),-0.18056321,0.07053299

I told him that I thought it was and pointed out on the one he was working on that I could see where he had cleaned and where he hadn't. He was working on the upstairs bathroom. I told him he needed to step out for a minute because I needed to use it. After I closed the door I realized the toilet was about to overflow. I flushed it several times and was playing with the mechanisms in the tank trying to get it fixed. I didn't want to use the plunger but was about to tell Matthew that he needed to get the plunger and fix it. Just at that time, some people came in and I realized they had been working in that bathroom. It was apartment maintenance men. I didn't even know they had been in there and done anything. I hadn't called them to do anything. They replaced the upstairs toilet with an older toilet that was all cracked around the rim and nasty looking. Where it was cracked, there were several colors light blue and yellow and I don't remember what other colors. They had also replaced the sink and counter fixture with this big ugly unit that had two trashcans built in, the kind you might see in some public bathrooms and it was a maroon color. It was also a double sink but the one sink was fairly small and rectangular in shape and the other one was round and regular size. I didn't like it at all. I questioned them as to why they were doing this when there was nothing wrong with the old fixtures. They didn't give me good answers. I didn't like the work at all. They basically just ignored me. Then a woman came in while they were here. She was from the apartment office and she said her name was Lao. I told her that as soon as these men left I would be calling her to talk to her about this. They gave me a form to sign and fill out. On several places on the form, I made it very clear that I did not like the work that they had done. That I had not requested it. That it was poor quality. One of them at one point said this isn't going to be good while he was watching me fill out the form. I just ignored him and kept writing. It wasn't the normal form that I fill out and sign when I have work done here. Then they pointed out a place for me to write some extensive comments. I wanted to get one of my own pens because the pen they gave me wasn't working well at all. I guess I thought. I don't know if I was actually talking to someone on the phone or if I was just thinking. When I called the apartment complex, I told them that I don't have a problem with John D or any of the men that normally work for him at all. They almost always do an excellent job. However, I was not pleased with this at all. As someone who has lived here almost four years, I think this is inappropriate to come in and have something like this done without my knowledge or consent. I had no problem with the previous fixtures.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-03-24),-0.24775513,0.07029293
210,"I was working somewhere but I don't know where. I think it was a medical office. They put me in the back office and made me a filing clerk. The manager always made sure everyone else was placed above me. They brought a new man into work next to me but doing slightly different abilities. He kind of reminds me of Cal U. Someone came back, was talking to him and asked him what he does there. He said he is a filing clerk. My first thought was what is he doing in a job like this? Then I thought that's good that he's not letting his ego keep him from being responsible. Some vendors brought in a bunch of merchandise to sell to employees. They set up booths to display it all. They had jewelry and furniture. I went to look at the rings but by the time I got there, all of the medium size ones were gone. All that was left were very dainty ones and huge ones. One was like a neon light. It kept changing colors. Betty N was there. I started walking around to look at other things. There were very large wooden pieces of furniture. I opened this one unusual chest. I liked it but decided it wasn't quite what I was looking for. I was walking around Susan J. We looked at some kitchen furniture. I asked her if she saw anything she couldn't live without. She said no. We kept walking and saw various knick-knacks behind colored glassware. I went back to my desk and tried to call Tim W again. He worked for the same company. I had left a message a day on sales floor. I had also gone to his office to try to find him and talk to him. When I tried to call this time, I got a wrong number first. I looked in a book for a number to get the corporate directory on voice mail. When I got his number, I got through but I heard him talking to someone else. I hung up but then called back. This time I spoke with him. He said, you want out of there don't you? I said, Yes, I do. Then I said, let's see. A masters degree working as a file clerk. What's wrong with this picture? It wasn't until the other man said he was a file clerk that I would admit that's all I was too.

We knew that we needed to put most of the things together and save it until we came back to formally divide up all of there things. I was walking around looking for a picture. Then we decided we would go in a room where we took everything down and put it in one room, that we would just go in there and took turns selecting one thing. I was upset because the two pictures I wanted most, BJ had taken already. I ended up taking a picture of a farm with a barn and cow on it. I thought it was kind of cool and reminded me of her. It was one of the ones I remember most looking at when I was back there. While we were dividing these things up, some other people kept brining some other stuff in this room. We had to keep asking them to carry it back because it was stuff we were saving until we had our formal division of property.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-05-04),-0.19909643,0.0011854388
230,"I went to work for a woman business owner. The job was something about presenting programs to groups. I was talking to one of her employees about ADHD and how it affects your life. We thought it would be a great idea to market a program about ADD, educating people about signs and symptoms, treatment, living with ADD, how people with ADD are treated by others. The owner of the business liked the idea. She said the other employee could do all the clerical work and I could just do the presenting. I told her I thought it would be a full-time job so why not build enough into the cost of the program to pay me as a full-time employee and let me handle most of that: registration calls, set arrangements, etc. I think she agreed. I told her I had a voice mail only number that we could use and that I would put together a business plan. She didn't seem to see a need for a business plan. Her other employee wanted to try my meds for ADD. They both wanted to get something to drink first. Then I gave her one _ pill, telling her that's all she should take. I broke one in half with my fingernail. They said something about me using my fingernail. I commented how tough my nails are. The employee said something about using Sally Hansen products on her nails. I turned around and said I do too. Then I saw she had Sally Hansen products lined along her desk. I said, I use, then went to the desk to try to find the one I use and picking it up as I finished the sentence, saying NuNail. I then realized how short my nails were at that time so I explained that I often have to cut them down because they get too long or if I break two or more off below the quick I cut them all down so they look even.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-05-18),-0.31822437,0.14167011

235,"I was at a kind of indoor flea market. It reminded me of the antique mall across the street but it didn't seem to be antiques, or at least not all antiques. When I first walked in there were these children dressed up in toy-like costumes. They were standing perfectly still until I entered the room and then they started running around. One of them came up and hugged me. One of them, a girl, had her head bent down and was brushing her head up away from her neck. She had said she wasn't hot but I noticed a red rash on her neck and asked again as it reminded me of heat rash. Then she said yes, she was hot. One of the things that I saw in the market was a jewelry armoire filled with LRJ and books. At first, I didn't know what it was until I saw the books. As I picked up a book, a man working there said he was just now reading the book but if I had questions, he would help me. I looked to see if they had any of the items that I now own that are damaged or pieces missing, like one earring missing. They didn't. I didn't recognize any of the pieces they had. I closed the armoire and moved on. I went into a room and saw all of the chains of big colored, plastic beads lying all over the floor. Someone told us what they were, but I don't remember now what they called them. Another woman shopping there thought they were great. She started looking at them to purchase some of them. Someone took some of them apart and there were beads rolling around all over the floor. Someone picked up something else to show us how easy these beads were to pick up. She stuck this thing in the beads, it picked up several at once, and then she put them in a bucket of sorts. I tried it, as did a few other people. It was interesting how it worked. I decided to leave. I finally found an exit but it led into a maze. I hesitated momentarily because I really don't like mazes. They make me claustrophobic and I'm afraid I can't get out. I went ahead. It was all wood, top, bottom, and sides. There was a tape playing while you went through it. It was a male voice of an advertisement for the flea market/store. At one point in the maze, you had to lie down to continue going through and something kind of sucked/pushed you through. I really didn't want to do that but didn't think I had a choice and it was very short so I went ahead. At the end of the maze, there was another place like this. I went ahead since the first one was no big deal. However, this one turned out to be very long. I started getting panicky and trying to figure out a way out. It finally let me out on the outside of the market. It was the end of the maze.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-05-23),-0.20316842,0.09813833

They were going to pay Kathy U $65 an hour for this job and Kathy U was only going to pay me $20 an hour. She wanted to talk to me, but asked me to wait. While I was waiting, I took an elevator downstairs. Lilly H and Tony U were there from SVH. There was also this map on this ceiling. The woman I would be working for and some other people needed to take all the pins out and stuff. I got up on this chair and was helping them dismantle this map. Some had flag heads, some blue balls, and some regular straight pins. I had a clear plastic box that I was putting them in but I kept dropping and losing some of them. I would put them in my hand until I could put them in the box and then I would drop them.

I pulled some other things out. I remember that I had some dolls and some things of flowers. I think Michelle Stewart [unknown in waking life] was working there also. They were thinking about moving us to a different area where there were all these desks in one big open area. She had kind of staked out the area, the desk that she wanted already.

There were two main female characters that I kept calling the divas. They were Audrey T and Karen Mc. For them I had bought black skirts, black suit coats, and black shoes. But they were each different. Not exactly alike. There was some jewelry. There were earrings. kind of like faked gem earrings but they looked very nice. Maybe some bracelets. For the rest of the cast, their costumes were Native American and something. This is weird. There was something almost like a black robe. They were really heavy. There were these hats too, that looked more like Mexican. Really weird and ugly. Yet, the jewelry was Native American. But I had bought them each a watch with black band but they were all different. The hats and clothing looked the same. When we were done rehearsing they were all getting ready to leave. I said Oh wait! I have costumes for everyone. You can take these home with you. Someone was helping me spread it all out on the stage so they could take it home with them. I had all the jewelry in a bag. I dumped it out. It was all tangled up and I was trying to separate it out. Someone was trying to help me separate it out and put the earrings together and the necklaces together. There were bracelets and then the watches. I was trying to remember. I had the Diva's earrings in a separate bag. I was trying to remember if I bought watches for them or not. I don't remember. I don't remember how that worked out. The earrings were very pretty. I don't know why I thought it was Native American because it doesn't look Native American to me now. I don't know why I said that. There were some children too. So there were two separate piles of costumes. They didn't look Native American either. They weren't the black either. Someone picked one up. It was a jacket, not like a suit jacket, but it was loose fitting and colorful, like maybe orange or yellow. Someone said something about the people would. maybe I made an apology about the costumes. and someone said the audience would love it just like they would the play. And I thanked them for saying that about my play, that people would love it. Audrey T and Karen Mc came out with their jackets on but not the skirts. Audrey T said the skirt just didn't fit. I told her she could just wear some black slacks or something with it. So she started trying on shoes to decide which shoes she wanted. Then Karen Mc came out and said her skirt didn't fit either. She said she could only get it up to the bottom of her butt. She said maybe could wear something to cover the rest up.

252,"I went to the Y to play racquetball with Matthew and a friend. I don't know who it was, just that it was someone I know. We were going to play doubles. The fourth was one of the employees of the Y - the young black man with a beard and Afro that is there quite often. We were assigned the last court. We went in and there were piles of boxes and shelves in the back right of the court. It left very little playing room. The Y employee wanted to play around it. I was upset and didn't see how that was possible, but we decided to try anyway. Then we didn't have racquets. We were trying to play with metal kitchen spatulas. Obviously, we kept missing the ball this way. I finally decided to go ask at the front desk if they had any racquets. The front desk area did not look like it does in waking life. There was an open area that we walked into. They were very busy. Several people behind the desk. which is unusual, and lots of customers on the outside of the desk. I asked for racquets and they handed us two. When we got back to the court we tried to use them but they weren't made for racquetball. One was more like a golf club. I finally went back to the desk and asked again. This time they were going through what they had trying to find what I was really looking for. They pulled a couple out that I told them were Ping-Pong paddles. We finally got two racquets. When I got back to the court I realized they were both bent. Half way up the racquet the rest of the racquet was bent towards me. This time when I went in I saw some other employees were clearing all of the mess out of the back corner. I thought that was good. Somewhere I saw Garnet P. She was there working. something to do with paint and crafts. She told me I had to complete my paint work. I stopped my racquetball to do what she said. I began mixing some paint and got some on the sleeve of my black cashmere winter coat. I was very upset and said I wasn't going to do this anymore and didn't know why I had to do it anyway. Someone said it was part of the class. I said I wasn't in the class. Garnet P tried to clean off my coat. I also had paint on the back of one of my favorite black heels. She tried to get it off of there too. These people who were painting were in the halls everywhere and making it very difficult to get around and to the courts. One woman sitting next to me was painting this mailbox, maybe on ceramic, as it had form to it. First she painted the whole thing a rust color. Then she painted what would have been the open space sky blue. She painted the mailbox yellow, the grass etc. green. I think there were also flowers. After everyone had finished the instructors were talking about people's work. They especially liked this woman's ability. She had also painted a picture of herself. Garnet P was just there as a representative of the paint company. They were also looking at two large collages that the group had made. Some of it was done with the tubes of glitter paint like I use. One woman drew something and they were teasing her about being a piehead. She was swimming, looked something like a turtle, and she had painted pictures of pies in front of and behind herself. I was walking around trying to find my shoes. I found them but in doing so stepped in some black paint. Then, I accidentally stepped on a piece of paper that appeared to be painted solid yellow. I was worried that I had ruined someone's painting. Then I noticed several other similar pieces, of different colors, that others had stepped on too, so I didn't worry about it anymore. I pointed to the stain on my shoe to Garnet P and asked her how to get the rest of the paint out. She hushed me and said just a minute. I made my way to the racquetball courts. I looked in each door trying to find the one that Matthew and the Y employee were in. When I found it, I went in just as they were going out a side door. There was another man sitting in there and I asked him and he pointed that they had just gone out that side door. I was aggravated.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-06-27),-0.26723063,0.022478111

I thought that brush would work fine since they were just puppies and very small. Their hair was matted, kind of like an old stuffed animal. After I brushed them, their hair was silky, soft, just like Belle's. Someone said all the puppies hadn't had their shots so we couldn't give them away yet.

261,"I was working for this man in a store in the mall. I'm not sure what kind of store it was. maybe a pet store. The only animals that were there were a whale, a cow, and a goat. and later a calf. The store was a very contemporary decor with deep vivid colors. One color in particular that I remember is purple. There were also a few very long steps leading up to a main open area. That was the majority of the room. The only thing I remember being in here though was a large aquarium tank holding the whale. The whale was not the same size as it would be in waking life. It was approximately 5 feet long and its diameter was slightly smaller than my own. I was very concerned about the whale. I kept adding water to the tank and the whale kept getting out and I kept putting it back in. I had put the whale is something similar to a pillowcase because I thought that would be better for it. Later the owner told me that the whale was dying and there was nothing we could do to save it so I took it out of the pillowcase. The whale just lay in the water from that point on. We realized that the goat and cow had gotten loose and gone out into the mall. There was another young woman and a young man that worked there. The goat came right back but the young woman and I were going out into the mall to look for the cow. There was another woman there, I believe she was the lover of the storeowner. She was going to go to the left in the mall looking for the cow and the other girl and I were going to the right. Before the two of us left, however, I suggested we call mall security and see if anyone had called a reported the cow on the loose. I have a sense that I didn't like the owner's lover very much so I didn't care if she was out searching the mall needlessly. We did get the cow back from security. Then we realized that there was a calf missing so the female employee I was with was going out into the mall in the other direction and search for the calf. There had been some joking around about me going to bed with the owner. I was teasing him that he had never been with anyone like me, no one else would measure up after, etc. He had an apartment above the store. I went up there once and saw him in bed with the other female employee. I don't know how I knew it but he was one to sleep with a lot of different woman for no reason other than sex. The cow was dying also so we let the cow and whale lay together to comfort each other until they died. I went upstairs to talk to the owner about the animals dying. I was very sad and saw that he was too. We were especially sad that the whale was dying. I asked if there was anything I could do for him. He said he would just like me to lay and cuddle with him to give him comfort. I thought that would give me comfort as well so I agreed. But things progressed as he teased me a little bit. Unfortunately, it didn't stop there and we ended up making love. But it really was that, not just having sex. It was incredible. He had undressed and then I undressed while he watched. I was wearing black lingerie. The one female employee came up and saw us in bed together and was very upset. He called me later and told me he was done with other women. That he was very surprised because he had given up hope of finding his soulmate but he knew he had found that in me. I felt the same way. The other female employee and the male employee were both upset when they learned that we had made love. The male employee was jealous and hurt that I chose the owner instead of him. The owner and I ended up getting married. I came downstairs. We closed the store and locked the door. Someone was knocking at the door and I couldn't see who it was. So I put the chain on so I could open it safely and see who it was. It was something about the goat or the calf. We decided to change the store, I think into a restaurant. The next time I went upstairs to the apartment he had completed remodeled it. It was fairly contemporary in decor. probably not what I would choose in waking life. but I loved it in the dream. The floors were all hardwood. It was one huge open space. The bedroom was upstairs in an open loft area with a winding staircase leading up to it. There were several area rugs on the floor. I was looking for the stereo. I wanted to put some music on so we could dance. A doctor came to the apartment because I was having some type of physical problem. I was observing the doctor my husband and myself. I was talking about how I looked. re: the medical problem. The doctor had me bend over towards my toes and she was looking at my face. My husband came down from the bedroom are. We were talking a little about money. It had something to do with a $1,000. He said, It's no big deal.

I found the DDSI meeting. I was sitting at a round table with 8-9 people. Jeannette T and Marcia N were there. I thought, oh, they do both still work for WDF. I recalled that I had thought about contacting Marcia N for a job before but now see that she is still happily working for WDF. I also noticed that they did not present themselves as they used to. They used to be very particular about their appearance regarding make-up, hair and clothing. At this meeting they appeared somewhat unkempt; no make-up and their hair kind of messy. Marlene F was there. I was surprised that she was there. I decided that she had perhaps bought a franchise in FWI. Later, at the meeting I think, they were doing something and talking about something in a treasure chest. Vince P and someone else wheeled in this very large gold square box that was supposed to be a treasure chest. Vince P was pulling it into the room by a rope. It was about 4 feet high and 4 feet square. Now it seemed as though I was sitting with Patti C and the treasure chest is small and sitting on the table in front of us. We are looking at the contents. It is all bags of candy. We realized that each kind of candy represented a different award so we were counting each kind of candy to determine how many of each award there was. The only kind I remember is Jelly Beans and that was the one there was the most of. One of the franchise owners was standing up talking to Vince P and Joanne N. I think they were recognizing what they had done for the franchise owners. She was pulling out these little toy figures, about two inches tall. They had been buried under the bags of candy. Each different figure under a separate kind of candy. When I realized this I tried to put the candy back exactly how I had found it. I went into the DDSI office and was looking for people I know, just to say hello. I realized that Joanne N was the only one there that I knew, but I decided to go ahead and say hello. I walked into this office building lobby and there were these three unusual people. I don't know how to describe them.

They had the wires stretched from wall-to-wall. The aprons had various Christmas designs on them. I thought I should get one because I had intended to start wearing an apron in the kitchen. As I was walking around the room, there were tables displaying things that people had made. The things that I remember most were drink pitchers with matching glasses. They had painted designs on them. I was in a car with John Mu and Terri S from KTC. I don't know where we were headed but John was driving. We were seeing Halloween decorations at different places. As we went through underpasses, we saw that someone had put up giant Jack-0-Lanterns. This is next to impossible for me to describe. The best I can, is to say that where there were open spaces the Jack-O-Lanterns showed through. There were umbrellas and very unusual decorations. We stopped at one house and I don't know why. There were two young boys who lived there. They had built something they called an elevator out of wood. They had a rope that you pulled to lift yourself to the second floor. Right outside on the second floor was a patio door. Terri S said she was going to play with the boys, go outside, and use the elevator. The boys noticed her right away, came out, and asked what she was doing using their elevator. She came back down. The boys said something to their parents about someone using their elevator. She got back in the car and we left. I was debating with someone over whether or not to wear these gloves. I was at a theater. We were getting ready to produce a play. I was not supposed to be in the play. I don't know what my role was. At first, it seemed like we were doing a play of My Fair Lady. Later it seemed like we were doing a children's play like Barbie. It seemed to change several times throughout the dream. I don't remember what it ended up being. I spent a lot of time with the male producer/director back stage. Something like a hand vacuum was broken and he was trying to fix it, though he was unsuccessful. He was using a very small hammer. I took the hammer from him and told him to let me help. I decided I needed a larger hammer so we were looking for one. I finally found one and I fixed it. He was grateful for that. We started talking about very common things that I experience, but he had never had. Things like chips and salsa. He was very wealthy and just had not experienced very ordinary things. Over the course of us working together, he fell in love with me and he asked me to marry him. I said yes. We didn't tell anyone at first. The backstage area really sticks in my mind. There was clutter everywhere. At one place, you had to step down into another area. You stepped onto a floor of car batteries. There were two different levels of batteries. You had to walk on them instead of the floor. You couldn't even see the floor. He was waiting to tell the cast and crew about our engagement. It somehow got out but I don't know how unless he told someone. Most of the crew and cast were very happy for us. I was talking to someone about jobs and trying to find jobs that we really love. I said that I had been in school plays and that I really loved doing that. This is true in waking life but I would not imagine myself doing that full-time in waking life. She was encouraging me to pursue that as my full-time job. I had been thinking that was watching the other actors perform, that I should have been behind them practicing and learning the moves. I thought that would have been a good move for me, but I didn't do it. The play was a musical with a lot of dancing. I thought I could have learned the moves if I had practiced with them instead of just sitting and watching. I could have done this. Later the word got around to the whole cast about our engagement. One of the main female cast members was attracted to him, very upset about this, and intended to make sure it did not happen. It was almost as though I was watching a film. I wasn't with her or overhearing her, but watching her talk and interact with other cast members. Her and these other women were all dressed in costumes that remind me of My Fair Lady. Later, another woman, not in the cast, shows up and is talking to him. Again, it is not as if I am there watching, but I am seeing it. This woman is talking to him as though they are in a relationship and nothing has happened. He is very cool towards her and she doesn't understand why. I'm talking to this little girl. I asked her name and she said Annie H. I told her that is one of my favorite names because my middle name is Anna and my favorite Uncle used to call me Annie. I told her some about Uncle A. She said she was very happy that this man and I are going to marry. I don't know who she was, maybe a member of the cast. Several times he and I kissed. Usually, very long and passionate kisses. One time it was right in front of other cast members. That must have been when they found out. This news caused so much trouble with the cast that I think he backed off and I can't remember if he actually changed his mind. He was going through a lot of turmoil about whether to marry me or not.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-08-05),-0.04762074,0.14951693
272,"I was the owner of a large styling salon. A salesman came in to demonstrate and try to sell me a vacuum. It was a very powerful machine. I tried it out by vacuuming the entire salon. I used the attachments and vacuumed hair from around the baseboards. I accidentally moved the attachment right by a client's face and the stylist insinuated that the vacuum removed her facial hair from that side of her face by complimenting the client on how beautiful her skin was. I looked and noticed that she had facial hair on the other side of her face. I didn't do or say anything else about it. I finally told the salesman that I was going to be working on budgetary items during the coming week so I would be able to give him my decision then. I wanted the vacuum but I also think I was trying to give him an excuse rather than saying no to him at that point. My husband owned an auto and appliance repair business right next door to my salon. I went and talked to him about my intentions with budget and that I was considering some business changes that would improve both sales and profits and allow the stylists to make more money as well. I found out that my stylists rarely get any tips. I suggested that we should put a little sticker on the corner of each of their mirrors that says Tips are appreciated as this is an important part of our stylists income. When I first started talking to my stylists about some of the changes I was going to make all but 2 or 3 of them got up and quit. Eventually they all came back. I think as they spoke with the ones who stayed about the changes they became convinced that it would be a very good thing. My husband wasn't very supportive but he didn't stand in my way either. He didn't want me to do anything with his business though. I did suggest that they put up a basketball goal on the corner of his lot so the employees could relax a little on their breaks by shooting hoops. I also thought this was something that the employees wanted. I don't know if it actually happened or not. there was some kind of an evil person trying to sabotage my business. I don't remember much about this part. I did find out later that he was connected to my husband. as though my husband was behind it. I managed to get rid of this person though and the changes were being very successful. The stylists were dressing much nicer when they came to work. They were much happier, getting nice tips, and the clients were very happy with the changes. There was one stylist that was the hardest to win over. She had studied clinical counseling but then decided to become a stylist instead. She took care of her clients in a private room so they could speak privately with her while she took care of them. She wasn't acting in an official counseling capacity but used her knowledge to help them while she was taking care of their styling needs. She combined them in a manner as to not put herself or us in any kind of legal jeopardy. She was very happy when I encouraged this and gave her a private room so she could do so more effectively. Her clients were especially pleased with her. They had something to do with an airline or flights. There was a person that looked like or was dressed like an angel or a fairy, with sparkling wings that fell gently from the sky. She landed, or her wings became caught, on something like bleachers. This is where I found her and freed her. She was somehow connected to my husband and this evil person that I had to deal with earlier. Maybe she was a distraction.

278,"I had gone to a morning OD meeting at a restaurant. There weren't very many people there and it wasn't structured. People were getting up and walking into the kitchen. Some were just walking around. We were the only ones in the restaurant. I talked primarily to one gentleman. I was trying to get something useful from this meeting. He was talking about OI. In waking life I have no idea if there is even such a thing. It seemed as though it was industrial OD. I was asking him if he thought that was a good area for me to pursue. I kept stressing that I what I want most to do is use my training/lecturing and writing skills. The whole meeting seemed very unhelpful. I left there and went to the anniversary party. I got there late, in time for the reception. I missed the mass because it had started earlier than I thought. I was aggravated with BJ because she didn't tell me what time I needed to be there. I wondered if people got videos of the Mass so I could at least see that. They were taking lots of pictures. One thing that was particularly unusual is that there was a corner curio cabinet with glass shelves. There was a space in the back of the cabinet between the back of the shelves and the back of the cabinet. They were having people sit in the cabinet in this space. They were taking pictures of each person in attendance in this cabinet and they were putting things on the shelves that represented each person. They were thinking about what to put on the shelves to take my picture. There were some barbecued chicken wings that I was eating. Bob F asked me how they were. I was nice and said they were good. I thought the sauce was good but that if had bought the chicken at another store they would have been juicier or more tender and with more meat on them. There was one table that members of the Harris family were sitting at. They had a very large tray and they had made high piles of desserts on it like cake and brownies. They had filled it full of things they were going to take home with them. I was taking the slices of cake off looking for something but then putting them back on. Linda W said that was fine as long as I didn't mess up their cake. Kim H went to the microphone. This was a dream within a dream. At the end of the dream I was with my siblings telling them I had this dream and that we could use it to see what things happened that we didn't like and what things we did that we especially liked but maybe weren't planning.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-07),-0.17436288,0.056401853
280,"Cindy S was dead. For some reason we had to exhume her body and there was someone else that we had to bury. I think we were going to bury this other person, maybe, right next to where she was buried. We didn't want to do it at the same time because we didn't want to impose on the S's while they were exhuming Cindy S's body. We talked to one of the S boys to make sure that wasn't going to be a problem. They assured us that it wasn't. Steve S was her brother. [but he was her cousin in waking life] I think Paul S was also her brother. [Paul S was also a cousin in waking life and deceased] . Maybe Tim S and Don St, though they are cousins also. In waking life, Steve S, Paul S, Don St and Tim S are all brothers. When they exhumed the body it wasn't in a casket but was wrapped in. It almost looked like aluminum foil but it was much larger than if the body was just wrapped in foil. It was like there were a lot of layers. I can't really explain it. I also don't know who the other body was that we were burying. Cindy S was alive again. Then she was dead again and they reburied her. After they reburied her I was wearing a necklace of hers. I don't know if she had given it to me or how I got it or why I was wearing it. Her father, not her waking life father, came in to church and sat down next to me because he had not been able to be present at the time that they exhumed the body and then reburied her because he had to be at a business meeting. I showed him the necklace to reassure him that it was her and that she was doing well and tried to give him some comfort. I thought how sad it was that on such an occasion that he could not be present because of a business meeting. We were back at the cemetery and I was picking up these sticks. In diameter they were the size of a pencil but they were much longer. On the end they had a kind of crook on them and they were light green. I was picking them up and sticking them in the ground at each gravesite that something had to be done to them. I was trying to find these open, vertical pipes or something so I could put the stick down into the pipe. I did four in a row. It was to mark the graves for something that had to be done later. Some of the graves had folded lawn chairs sitting up against the tombstones. People would come and sit there at the grave of their loved ones. One of them was Uncle E. I was thinking that Aunt M probably goes and sits there quite often.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-09),-0.07464885,0.026410129
284,"I was on a teleconference call with Darren and someone from the child support office. She was asking questions about the status of our child support agreement. As usual, I was getting more and more angry with Darren and found myself yelling at him. I was flipping through my file cabinets while I was talking to try to have the exact numbers in front of me when I spoke. I said, you make $56,000. Then I hesitated and changed it to $74,000 a year and still think that $70 a week in child support is adequate. He then told the other person on the phone that he wanted to file a petition for the child support to go directly to Matthew. While I was talking on the phone BJ's family arrived, suitcases in hand, and Matthew was taking them into his bedroom to get settled. I'm not sure why they were here, especially to spend the night. I noticed that Mike A was with them and I couldn't believe it. Then I thought I don't know where I am going to put all these people as other members of my family were going to be arriving as well.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-18),-0.21795847,0.09787083
287,"I was preparing to fix myself a meal. I went to the freezer and decided that I should eat something that I have had in there for some time. In the process I found things I didn't realize were in there or things that I had forgotten were in there. I took a round, forest green tablecloth folded in half out to the front porch, deciding that I would eat out there for a change. It was a classic picnic table like you would see in a park. There was already a cranberry colored tablecloth on the table so I placed the green one, still folded, over part of one lengthwise side of the table so you could see both. I think I placed something else on the table too but I can't remember what it was. I went back inside and started rearranging the things in the refrigerator. Now I was working in a dorm-side refrigerator, finding all kinds of things. I thought, I keep forgetting this one is even here. I found things that we had put in that freezer, leftovers from my son's high school graduation party in June. There were two packages of hot dogs; each one had been opened so I combined them. There were ziplock bags of sliced cheese and crackers that I decided to put in the other refrigerator so I would remember to use them for my bedtime snack. There was a package of sausage. As I was moving things I found some very old lettuce in the back. I took it out and laid it aside to throw away. I also found an individual serving bottle of juice with no lid on it. There were a couple of things that were just a bite or two and I took them out thinking that I would just consume them now rather than keeping them and I wouldn't dare just throw them out. I took the juice bottle out to drink right away as well. As I was picking up the lettuce off the floor I put it in the sink to put in the garbage disposal. Now it was much more than when I took it out and there were other things as well. It filled one side of the sink. While I was doing this, there were three men sitting at my kitchen table. One of them was interviewing the other two about 911. They kept glancing at me and what I was doing. For some reason I also had tools and parts lying on the floor around me as though I was fixing the refrigerator as well. I realized I would have to move some of these things when they were ready to leave or they would not be able to get out. I did this as I saw them wrapping up and they got up to leave. The interviewer left and the other two stood there and talked with each other. The one started crying because the interviewer had given him such a hard time.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-09-22),-0.12859632,0.052315496
291,"I can't place where we were, but we were someplace for school. I spoke with Monty about my paper and he was irritated, disappointed. He was talking to me about my paper and how there were several questions and I only answered one of them, and even then I only answered with a couple of paragraphs. It was just barely passing work. He just didn't understand and was really bothered by this. He said, I'm sorry. I said, no, don't be sorry. I feel the same way. My work has not at all been what I would like it to be. This aren't really excuses but. I told him about the year I've had being unemployed, etc. So unfortunately it was not just your class that suffered. It was the others as well. In some way that made him feel a little better. Still, he was a little disappointed. So I asked him if there was anyway to make it up or to redo the paper or add to it or anything. He didn't think that was possible. we were laying in the grass together, like spooning. There was clearly some affection there.

298,"I was at a class reunion. I don't remember many of the people that were there. I do remember Susan J, Jake G and Darren. We were sitting in what appeared to be an old house at a large wood oval dining room table. We were just chatting and catching up and were laughing a lot. As more people began showing up we were looking for the other leafs of the table to add in so we could all sit around one table. We thought that everyone who would show up would fit around this one table. We thought that would be really nice to be able to do that. We all started getting up and pulling the table apart. We decided to pull it into another room so we would have room to expand it more. Then we decided to take some of the two-person square tables and put them at the end of this oval table and just keep making it longer and longer by adding those. So we started moving those in. Some of them were a bit taller than others so we tried to keep all those together at the end. As we were putting the square ones next to the oval ones, I was talking to someone and Jake G. We were talking about our little radio or TV program that we had done together. I said something about something that he had messed up. He admitted it. We were kind of laughing about it. I couldn't remember exactly what it was. I said, well, I did too. It wasn't anything critical, just nice memories. I was standing there looking at him thinking that he was as attractive now as ever, except that he was much nicer now. I was looking for a place to sit and I didn't want to sit next to Darren again as I was before we moved the table. It looked like there weren't any seats left. As I was walking around the table looking for a spot to sit, and I wanted to sit next to someone I knew fairly well, I walked behind Susan J and I rubbed her back. I was going to say something and my eyes started tearing. I though dang it, I don't want to cry. This is ridiculous. She looked at me and said what? I said, I wanted to say something but my eyes started tearing up. Several people started laughing. I sat on a ledge behind them. I said, I'm just like my dad. I was kind of joking but I started crying a little bit too. Then I just started laughing uncontrollably. I hid my face trying to compose myself. What I was thinking that I wanted to say was that I had been looking through my old autograph books and I was going to say that I had been doing that and I found something that she had written. I was very touched by it and that is what was making me want to cry.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-10-02),-0.19421543,0.087593175

312,"I went to a Kroger store to get my prescription for Concerta filled. I was talking to them about it. I told them that I used to work for People's Drug Stores and from that experience I knew that different stores in one chain would have different prices on items depending on their location. I wondered if that was the same for them and their prescriptions. At first he acted like he didn't want to tell me then he kind of nonchalantly acted like he didn't know. I had the feeling that he did know but he didn't want to tell me. I was walking around the store waiting for my prescription to be filled. It was a very small store for a Kroger store. It was more the size of a drug store. They were telling other people that I used to work for People's Drug Stores. They introduced me to one man in particular, but I can't remember why they introduced me to him or who he was or what his role was. My prescription was finally ready and I went to pick it up and it was over $200. I said, Oh, wait a minute. When I came to get it filled the last time it was only $125. Of course, that was a different store. I can't do this. I've been unemployed for the last year. I've been having enough trouble getting this as it is. They took it back. I went to get a bottle of Diet Sprite before I left. I realized I didn't have my purse with me so I put it back on the shelf and went out to my car to get my money. I saw my purse and my car keys laying on the seat and the door was locked. I was so angry. I went back in and they called AAA for me. While I was waiting they were having a company meeting so I just sat with them during their meeting. I kept watching out the window for AAA to arrive. They were going around the tables and talking about each person or having each person say something. I didn't think they would make me speak since I was not a part of their group, and they didn't. They passed by me. I saw AAA come so I ran out quickly. As I got out there I realized that my car keys were in my pocket. And AAA was actually a woman driving a mini-van. When I got out there and realized that I had my keys she was out of the van and lifting the rear door up to get ready to help me. I apologized for having called her out there for nothing. She didn't seem upset, like it wasn't a big deal. She said no, that was fine.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-10-17),-0.27020913,0.09001359
315,"I was going to work for Brad S and I had taken some hamburger with me to take home after I got off work. I put it in one of the desk drawers hoping that he wouldn't see it before we left. In his office there were two desks. His was sitting facing the door and the other was sitting at an angle facing his. I was sitting at the other desk. I don't remember what I was doing. As usual, there wasn't much to do. There were several people in there. I noticed my desk had stuff all over it just like his usually is in waking life, especially a bunch of pens. I start picking up these pens and testing them. A lot of them didn't write any longer so I threw them away. I thought to myself, why didn't he do that. Someone then asked me the same thing. I was trying to be nice and just said I don't know. He brought some new insurance man in to introduce to me. I was trying to be nice. I don't remember what kind of insurance he was selling. I told him I was satisfied with my current insurance policies. After all those people left, Susan J and Theresa Ay came in. I found that Susan J was working for him part-time and one full day a week and that Theresa Ay was also working for him. I got really angry with him and thought, no wonder I'm not getting any hours. I took my stuff and left. I was going through all these doors and hallways trying to get out. I noticed that Brad S was following me. I kept walking as quickly as I could and taking all of these different turns hoping to lose him. I finally got outside and I started flying right away thinking that was the best way to get away from him. I did. I lost him. Everyone else that was flying was flapping their arms to fly. I kind of turned on my back and was just enjoying how good it felt. Amy S had invited me to a lunch. There were quite a few people there. The attire was dressy. We went to kind of a fancy restaurant but it was a very long table with all of the female friends of hers. She was the only person I knew. All of the things we were eating were kind of colorful molds of things. Some of them were Jell-O molds. Some had mini-marshmallows covering them. I mentioned to her what Brad S had done about the hours and how angry I was that he had done that to me. A couple of people questioned it because I was trying to defend my position then. I stated that when I interviewed I got the impression that we agreed to my working 12 to 4 or 5, Monday through Friday and the weekly hours would be between 20 and 25. I stated that it has never been that way since I started. The first week I got 18 hours, and it has declined each week after that, with last week being only 2 hours. I was getting so angry talking about it. I learned that Susan J and all of these women were part of office services for the building where Brad S rents. One woman left to find out what was going on and she came back and told us that. I said, you know that really doesn't matter to me. It still doesn't make it right that he told me one thing and didn't follow through. I said I'm sure he didn't realize that Susan J and I grew up together and were best friends for a lot of years. I went and talked to Susan J to see if she was in fact doing this specialized stuff that they said she was and if she wasn't then she was basically doing the same thing he had me doing when he did have me come in. At that point different people started showing up and making all kinds of accusations about people. It was getting ugly and embarrassing. Some people were just sitting there because they didn't know what to do or say. I just decided that I was going to leave. Again, it was a series of doors that I had to go through to leave. They were all glass and some of them were revolving doors. I finally managed to get out. My car was sitting right outside the final door. I jumped in and locked the doors so that even if they did follow me they couldn't get in. I started it and put it in gear. I was in a cobblestone courtyard. It was fairly open but it had three places that you could probably drive through. They looked somewhat like alleys. All these women were walking around in floor length pastel flowing dresses and they all had boas. Some of them were bright colors, but they all had boas. I went ahead and put my car in gear.

320,"I went to see Alice S to ask her a couple of questions. I can't get a sense of the building I was in. Normally I would be either in the grade school, church offices, or in Shalom House. This was more like a very large, 3-4 story school or. It reminds me of Goodman Hall at SMW. I went into Alice S's office. It was very tiny and uncomfortable to me because it was so small and crowded. It had her desk and some shelves and filing cabinets, two sitting chairs with a table between them and another very small desk also. Alice S was in there. I had asked her something and she was printing a copy or getting a paper for me or for someone else. I'm not sure. The gentleman that works in her office at that very small desk was working at his laptop computer. His name was Scott. He closed it up and left. For some reason I had the sense that he wasn't going to be working there anymore. I asked Alice S what happened to Scott. She said, shh, like we shouldn't talk about it. I sat down in one of the chairs while I was waiting for her. She sat down at her desk and another man came in and started talking to her. He completely ignored me or didn't even see me there. He was standing right in front of me with his back to me and started asking her something. Then he left and a woman came in and actually closed the door behind her. She said, hi boss. Can I have ten minutes of your time? This was an older woman. She looked at me but completely ignored me and didn't say a word to me. Finally Alice S looked at me apologetically and said, would you mind? I said, why don't you give me one of your cards and I'll email you. My tone of voice showed my frustration. I was searching around her desk to pick up a card but I couldn't find one. She said, no, why don't you call me because I wouldn't want this to get lost among a bunch of emails. I said, fine again with the tone of voice. I was very perturbed that I had been there and these other people came in and ignored me and I was the one that kept getting put off. I went ahead and left. I was trying to find my way out of this building. There was also a young boy who seemed to be trying to find his way out as well. I don't know what happened to him as the dream progressed. I finally thought, if I go to the basement I will know my way from there. I went to the basement and then I started going up these escalators. They were not normal escalators but only 1/3 or _ as many steps as a normal one and they seemed to move a bit differently as well. These made me even more uncomfortable than the ones in waking life do. It was like you had to move especially quickly and carefully at the top to get off. I finally got up to this one floor and for some reason I got a wheelchair and was pushing it. I had to get through this one area and had these lines of people like you might see at a bank if there were many tellers and each had their own line. In every line there was at least one person sitting in a wheelchair and I had to get across the front of these people. Most of the people in the wheelchairs were being very nice about it. They had to back up a bit to make room for me to get through with this empty wheelchair. I kind of brushed up against a couple of them and apologized. I finally got through. For some reason it seems that I took the empty wheelchair just so I could get through. Someone asked me to take this woman in a hospital bed to her new room. She was being transferred to another room. I must have been at SVH. I realized later that I was. They didn't tell me what floor this woman needed to go to and she didn't know either. I stopped at this one place that was kind of like a snack bar window. I asked if they could make a call to find out where she was supposed to be. The manager was being very uncooperative. One of the male employees asked the manager if it was okay to offer the patient some free ice cream. He said that was fine and asked her if she would like some. She said yes so the employee gave her some vanilla soft serve ice cream in a cardboard bowl. I sat her up in her bed and she was eating her ice cream. While we were sitting there these younger adults came up. I thought I recognized the one woman but I didn't say anything. They were relatives of this woman in bed. They were surprised to see her and they chatted for a little while. Somewhere around this point she told me that she was fine and was actually there to do volunteer work. I don't know why she was in this hospital bed. I said, well, I'll tell you what though. Let's have you stay in the bed that way we will be able to get through these different floors without people questioning us. It will be easier for us to go through the various places in the hospital to find out where you are supposed to be. She agreed to that. I then said, let's start at the third floor because that makes most sense to me as far as a place to start. After she finished her ice cream and finished talking to her relatives I had her lay back down and I took her up to the 3rd floor. I went through a couple of departments and a couple of them said that this patient wasn't theirs. we went into this one area like a small pharmacy. I was having trouble maneuvering this bed around in there because the aisles were so narrow and short. While we were in there a doctor came running in yelling tube, tube, tube. He ran in a pulled a tube in a plastic wrapper off the shelf, ripped it open and just dropped the wrapper, and ran back out and down the hall. There were maybe 4 or 5 more doctors who came running down the hall towards us. They had blood all over them and some medical things in their hands. I thought they were running in to us. But I guess they decided they didn't need to. They calmed down and ran around and said yes he was breathing okay and the tube was clear. They went back and she had a concerned look on her face. I said don't worry, it will be okay. They won't have you volunteering any place that is really uncomfortable for you. The doctors that had blood all over them had splatter blood all over her face. I took a towel and gently wiped it off, I recall the most being on her forehead. We went on working our way to some departments trying to find where she was supposed to be. I came across a large male black nurse. I asked him if he could tell me where the admissions office is for this area. He told me where to go. I headed over there. I saw a nurse sitting by a desk. There was a very small newborn. maybe a preemie. next to her. I think it was in an incubator. She was on the phone. When she got off the phone I explained why we were there and that this woman was really fine. I had kept her on the bed so we could get through the various departments to find out where she was supposed to be. She was supposed to be volunteering. The nurse was very nice. She was a younger black female nurse. While we were waiting for her to get off the phone I was wondering if this was the new pediatric unit that SVH has been building, or if it was the new pediatric sleep center. At that point the nurse said the woman could get out of bed and she would take care of it from there. I could just take the bed out. I headed out with the empty bed and came across this male nurse again. He said he was on his way to put back another empty bed so I could just follow him. I jokingly said, oh, you were supposed to give me a ride now. He just laughed. He went really fast and I couldn't keep up with him so I was practically running to keep up with him. I guess staff thought I was playing with the empty bed or something because they were all looking at me and grinning. I saw Doctor C at the end of the hall so I aimed it at him like I was going to run into him. When I got up to him I stopped to say hello. His hair was completely gray. He spoke very briefly, but friendly. Just not what I expected after not seeing him for a year. I thought he would seem happier to see me. I just chalked it up to him being either very busy or in one of his moods. Either way this is how he would have acted so I didn't take it personally.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-10-27),-0.29100907,0.033218056
321,"I was with my family in St. Joe. I was thinking that it would be fun for us to all go to a professional baseball game together. Not sit all in one row but several rows, one in front of the other, so we can talk together more. The next thing I know we are there. I'm not sure who all was there but it was at least my parents and my siblings and I. I wanted something to eat and drink but no one else was so I wouldn't say anything. I took some money, a ten-dollar bill, out of my wallet, folded it up and put it in my shoe. Someone said something about it. I said I forgot to do it earlier and I don't usually put it in my shoe but that was easiest right now. We were referring to the fact that you are supposed to put money, like a one-dollar bill, on your person all the time for luck. I think I actually got the money out because I was hungry. A bit letter I noticed others eating and drinking and I was aggravated because no one offered to have me go with them or offered to get me anything. Brian F was eating potato wedges and drinking a coke. Later I noticed others had gone and gotten things too. Still later Brian F was now eating a cheeseburger and drinking a coke. BJ asked if I wanted to get some ice cream and I said no, I really didn't want ice cream. What I really wanted was the potato wedges and a sprite. While we were watching the game I was almost hit a couple of times by fly balls. I also noticed that in between the sections of the stands there were these very tall, white, plastic, flexible holders that were taller than the stands and they each held a golf ball at the end. The golf ball could be released and thrown somewhere. It had some purpose for the game. I thought it was very unusual. I was walking around with Brian F and BJ and we were talking about people writing and talking about the end of the war. I was thinking that if I had initiated this conversation a year ago they would have dismissed me and not paid any attention. Now BJ had heard this from someone else and was very intrigued and ready to discuss it. I recognized that things seem to come around to their geographic areas a year or so later than here. Kind of like the time lapse between New York and California fashions hitting other parts of the country. Anyway, we were talking about this one series of books, I believe they were written about The Rapture. Two of the women I worked with last year were really into them but I didn't read them because they didn't sound like they coincided with my beliefs. Anyway, BJ was very intrigued by the whole idea and Brian F was just listening with interest and as though he wanted to learn and understand. typical for Brian F. I remember saying something about this books talking about the world opening up and swallowing people and fires etc. I reminded them that they are still written by men, as was the Bible, and as were Conversations with God, by Neale Donald Walsh. I went on to say that it is impossible for us to know these things for certain. That even though these people claim to be writing from God's inspiration, they are still human men and fallible. I went on to say that we each need to find our own truth. we left the ball game and went to another place. I don't know what the place was. It was a semi-circle theater. The round stage was completely dark except for a spotlight on the man speaking. The back half of the round stage had individual dark curtains. Each curtain had the name of a place in lights. One of them was Lesourdesville Lake Amusement Park. We chose that curtain. Immediately we were transported to another place. I thought it was going to be Lesourdesville Lake but it wasn't. This is difficult to describe. It looked as though we were watching a movie scanning the night skyline of a large city, but at the same time it felt as though we were there. not physically flying and not in an airplane. which is why it is difficult to describe that part. But now it is suddenly daytime and we fly past the World Trade Center towers and they are on fire and smoking. I realize where we are and when and I become very upset and fight back tears. we are on a boat and it begins to burn. It quickly docks and people begin to get off. No one is panicking and I get off safely. There was a coral colored carpet and I had to go up several steps to get off, but it was almost mazelike. I had to go up a step, walk to one side for a little while and find an opening to go up the next step. There was one woman in particular with long sandy-brown hair. I don't know who she is but we said something to each other as we were leaving. we are back in the theater. My family members are all in seats. I am approaching them with a notepad in hand. I see the Homers sitting there as well. Kenny H is sitting on the end of the row. I sit down on the floor next to him to ask him about this experience. I am thinking that I am sure that I am still dreaming. I asked Kenny about his experience. He said they did in fact go where their curtain said they were going. He said they were awake in coming to the theater and they were awake now. I was disappointed to hear that because I was so sure to that point that I was still dreaming. I was writing feverishly to get everything down on a notepad. Some people came up behind us and set up a table and sat down there. They seemed to be upper-class people. My paper was making noise as I turned the pages and they were getting very annoyed. I was having trouble finding a clean sheet of paper but did not want to stop for fear of losing some of this. Matthew came up to me. He is a much younger boy, maybe 9 or 10. I was trying to gather all of my things to go and sit with him. I had lots of papers, a drink, and a winter coat. I was having trouble getting it all. Matthew helped. As we were walking to our seats we passed Darren. He said that Matthew had said he would visit with Darren after this. I was aggravated by this and said I would have talk to Matthew about this and we would see. We went to our seats.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-10-31),-0.21526782,0.010415418

333,"I went back to work as a store manager for SFI but I took over Pam T's store. It was such a mess. You could hardly walk into the backroom. There was merchandise everywhere and all kinds of odd things too, like little Christmas statues/knick knacks and decorations. Plastic containers and lots and lots of clothes. It was a mess!! After the first few days I had a very brief informal store meeting telling the staff what to expect over the next few weeks and over the next year. I told them what I had done at the previous store and what I would be doing and what I expected from them. One or two of the employees arrived late. We had forgotten to lock the door after all the employees got there. We had customers wandering in and we had to get them back we had to apologize. Some of them were a bit upset. We went back to our meeting. I told them I was going to be spending my time initially, getting the backroom in order and that I would expect them to take care of the sales floor. keep it neat and clean and orderly. Take care of the customers. Be very sales oriented, etc. When we left we went out through the back door. It was pitch black dark. You couldn't see anything. They tried to show me where the store key was hidden outside the store. I was comparing this to where we hid the key at the other store. In waking life we didn't do such a thing. I also talked about how dark it was and asked them if they normally bring flashlights. They said no they just deal with it. I made a mental note that I had to talk to Lisa S about that. On another day during business hours I went up to one of the employees and instructed her on recovery. She didn't seem really offended by my instruction. She asked a couple of questions and then got started. I also made a comment to all of the staff that I like to make surprise visits when I am not scheduled to work and that I had better never find a boyfriend or spouse visiting during working hours. There was a boyfriend visiting at that time so I went up to him and told him that he needed to go and the employee said she understood. He kind of wandered around and pretended to be shopping. I noticed this when I was instructing the other employee on how to recover the racks. Lisa S came for a visit. When she did I had the backroom in much better order. She didn't seem that interested. I didn't get the reaction from her that I wanted. She was pleased and certainly noticed the improvements. I said doesn't it look great? And she said yes. I said there is just so much merchandise back here. It was folded up on shelves. It was a long narrow backroom. She said yes but this store had gotten merchandise that a lot of the other stores did not get and that's why all the unusual stuff. We would be selling through most of this stuff over the winter season. We had both been working in the store and were exhausted and we just kind of collapsed for a little bit. There was an area where Lisa S actually laid down. I said, okay Lisa S it's time to exercise now. I turned on some exercise music and I started exercising. She said no way and finally did get up and moving and exercising. I also said something to her about that light and it being so dark outside the door at closing. She said that was up to the landlord. I said something really has to be done because it would be much less expensive for them to do something about it now then to deal with a lawsuit if something happens to an employee because of the lack of light. I was giving some employees something to sign. In the place that I sign I wrote Kroger instead of SFI. One employee was talking about how the recent changes I had implemented in the store were spilling over into the rest of her life and made some very positive changes.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-11-27),-0.31959954,0.13329473
338,"Before I arrived or before I got into the house I was talking on the phone or something about having had some surgery. So I was arriving in pajamas and a robe and I was talking about a itch and about how each time I scratched the itch my gown moved up a little bit and I was making jokes about that. So I was still joking about that when I entered the home to begin the lecture. I was using a hairbrush to scratch my itch. I was sharing my life story of my journey to finding my current path. It was an in-home lecture. Some of it was my family and some were, I suppose, friends of family. I remember specifically Mother, Daddy, Bev, Aunt P, Larry K, Bruce W, Dick W, Sue K, Linda W. At one point, when I was kind of caught off guard, I had forgotten that this was the purpose of this lecture so I was having a little bit of trouble composing myself to start to talk. I found myself very teary and didn't want this to be a tearful talk. I was also somewhat concerned because my parents were there and I was guarded on what I wanted to share in front of them and I also did not want to hurt them in anyway by anything I said. I finally got started and a couple of times people started their own conversations about unrelated things. I just quit talking until they all quit talking and decided to pay attention. I was thinking how rude that was and how much it irritates me. I find it disrespectful to a speaker. I went through a little bit of my history and I got to People's drug stores and I started that maybe I needed to fast forward through. just recap company closings, etc and how I took that as a sign to change career paths.

344,"I was with my CIIS classmates and we were at some kind of army facility. We were working on a project to reduce violence or develop methods other than weapons to defeat the enemy. We were having different meetings. At times I was frustrated because, as usual, people weren't hearing me or weren't truly considering what I was saying. We had found some toy green plastic army men. We had decided to make something like a biscuit and place the toys inside the biscuit. The others wanted to put them in before baking the biscuit. I told them they would melt that way and that we would have to put it in later. They all disagreed with me and they were going to go ahead and do it their way. Really strange. I don't know how that ended up but I think I saved one out to maybe do myself, my way. I moved on to the kitchen area where the men on KP duty were preparing meals. I learned that a lot of our men got sick from that food. One of the reasons was that they got salmonella poisoning from hamburgers that had been cooked but then had been left sit out too long. The cooks would not know how many to prepare at a time and they didn't want to run out so they would prepare more than they thought they needed. They didn't want to throw any away so they would leave them sit out until the next group of men came in to eat. I had suggested that they have a counter at the doorway. a bar like you see at an entertainment venue. so it would count the number of men coming in. The men in the kitchen would be able to see/watch it and could use that as a gauge to determine how many to prepare. The head cook thought that was a great idea and said he would take it to the proper decision-maker. I pursued that a little bit and told him I was going to follow up with him and see how that conversation went and so forth. I met someone and I introduced myself as the future VP of the US. He kind of chuckled. I chuckled too but said, you just watch. A little bit later I met Hillary Clinton. She was the President of the US. I again introduced myself as the future VP of the US. We chatted a bit and I said, I'll be following up on that counter idea. She looked at me quizzically as she didn't know what I was talking about. Someone else was in our conversation and said, we'll talk about that later. I went back to the kitchen and I was still looking at things there. It occurred to me, I suggested to someone, if we would be able to poison the enemy's food as an alternative to weaponry. They said yes that would probably be doable. might be fairly easy. There was a discussion about what kind of foods we would use and such. I overheard one of the men talking about getting a divorce when he gets home. I was talking to them about that and discouraging the idea. He said something to me that hurt my feelings. I said so and was being a little dramatic about it but not letting on that I was. He apologized and I said, we'll make that. I had been standing on the other side of the counter so I went around the corner and gave him a hug but he didn't let go. He was kind of joking around and kind of doing that for the benefit of his buddies there because they were getting a real chuckle watching us. Then he kissed me. A long time. Then he asked me how I learned to kiss like that. Then he whispered in my ear, you want to give them a real show now? We'll give them a little tongue. I said, You want to give them a real show? Just follow my lead. Because I didn't think the first kiss was that good.",elizabeth.tsv,(2001-12-09),-0.26952636,0.017778782

I told him I was feeling so much better since I was back on my medications and I thanked him for that. He gave me the bill and I headed to the counter where I normally pay. It was as though I was having trouble seeing. That only lasted for a few seconds. When I got to the counter to pay I noticed that the bills were different. They were no longer the two part forms. It was just a regular piece of paper. He had not written any amount due. I handed it to the nurse and she said I could just hold on to the paper and pay the bill on-line if you want or she could take a check.

I was hoping that I wouldn't see the head lying somewhere as I headed to my car. I went to the car and for some reason I went back in again but I don't remember why now.

442,"I was in St. Joe and taking one or more classes at ECHS. I knew quite a few other people who were doing the same. We would walk to class together. I know Paulette W was one of the people I walked with. On more than one occasion I found money as I was walking to class. At least twice I found one and two hundred-dollar bills. The first time I just kept them, even though I realized I should report them as found and let the owner claim them. I rationalized that I do not report loose change when I find it. The evening after I found the hundred dollar bills the second time I had a date with Dan H. I told him about finding the money. He said, well, of course, you are going to report it as found aren't you? I said that of course I was. Even though I was thinking that I really need the money and don't want to report it. I was late for at least some of my classes and thought it didn't really matter since it wasn't high school classes that I was attending. I recall seeing Sister Dora come out of a classroom close the door behind her, leaning her back against the door as she pushed it closed. One day I was dressed for class in a pair of shorts and a T-shirt type of top. I had on high socks with some kind of boot footwear. I thought it was a popular look but I wasn't quite comfortable with it. I liked it and I didn't. I thought it was stylish but wasn't 100% sure. I decided to change before leaving the house.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-28),-0.2552739,0.11944047
447,"I went outside, in the evening after dark, to do some yardwork. I was going to trim the yard and bushes primarily. I was thinking about how much I use to enjoy doing that type of work, and how therapeutic it can be. I went to my two shrubs and had decided to trim them myself since the apartment maintenance men had not gotten around to it in some time and they were badly in need of trimming. I realized this may cause me to have more shoulder problems, as when I pruned my lilac bush. There was something else about a lot of people doing this at their own homes but I don't remember that part. As I started trimming the bush to the left I realized it was almost completely dead and that I would call the office to see if it could be replaced. The dead branches were the rusty brown color that dead evergreens turn to when they die. I decided to go ahead and cut it all out now anyway, until they could get there with a new one. When I got to the second bush there were parts of it that were dead. I debated whether or not to cut the dead out. I wasn't sure if it would look worse to leave it in or take it out. I decided to go ahead and cut it out. After I did that I saw lots of tall weeds growing through that brush. I got down onto the ground, starting on my hands and knees and then eventually moving to a sitting position, and started pulling the weeds. Some of them were very large and thick but I was determined to pull them rather than cut them off so I could get the roots out. It seemed that the more I pulled out the more I saw. Some of them were a very bright lemon-lime color. As I was finishing up I was walking closer to the wall of the townhouse when I realized that all of my Canna flowers were gone also. I was stepping in very soft gooey mud. I was wearing my moccasins and I didn't want to get them all muddy, but I also didn't want to go into the house to change when I had so little left to do. I stepped back into the grass and scraped my feet in the grass trying to get rid of the mud before it dried on my moccasins. When I finished there was very little bush left. In the midst of this trimming, I saw four people heading to their respective cars on the other side of the street. One of them said something, which made me look. I think the child might have said hello to me and his father yelled at him not to do that. I went to the truck - not at all like any truck I've ever seen. almost looked like some type of armored vehicle - to say something to the father but he just pulled away. nearly hitting me. The other two people had gotten into a car in front of him and had already pulled away. I went and got a broom to start sweeping up the cuttings from the driveway. As I was doing so I saw a dead grey goat, a little older than a newborn goat perhaps, lying in the gutter at the end of the driveway. This was very upsetting. I didn't know what to do. I thought I would finish sweeping and then decide. I continued sweeping the clippings up the driveway towards the pile of clippings in the yard. As I did so, I found a dead deer in the driveway. This was even more upsetting. I made the same decision to finish first. As I did so I also found a dead cow that was white and caramel colored, and a black bear. I tried to sweep the clippings around them to the yard. As I was doing so the deer shook its head and stood up. Next the cow and then the bear did the same thing. The goat was, in fact, dead. I was stunned. But then they started talking. They were going to do something about the man in the truck and their purpose in life was to do something about other people like him. To fight unkindness and cruelty in the world. I wanted to join them and help them in their cause. At this point I was barefoot and I wanted them to wait until I got some shoes on but they didn't want to. It was cold outside and I didn't want to walk barefoot on the cement. Plus, I knew that you shouldn't do that because you might injure your feet. I decided to take my chances on catching up with them and ran into the house to put some shoes on. It seems as though I am a man now. The inside did not look like the inside of my waking life home. I hurried upstairs to get some shoes. My wife was there visiting with two other men. One was her father the other may have been a brother. My child was in bed asleep. The house was decorated for Christmas I was rushing around trying to find some shoes. I saw a slip-on sitting in the hallway. I tried to find its mate. I debated whether it was mine or not and whether it was a male or female shoe. I put it next to mine and decided that it would fit. I finally found the mate and slid it on. I ran outside. As I did this I realized that my wife would so love to do this and seldom gets the opportunity. I went back into the house and let her go instead. They got into a vehicle together and left. I am a woman again now, myself in waking life. I was sitting with three other women on my bed. The house was decorated for Christmas. We had all just awakened from naps. I started telling them about the dream I just had about the bushes. We were extremely surprised and excited to find out that all four of us had dreams with very similar elements, centered around the bushes. Three more women entered the room. [I only know one of the women sitting on the bed and can't think of her name in waking life-just that she was a member of JLI and was single when I knew her. Two of the women who just entered the room I don't know.] Marlene F was the third woman who entered the room. I motioned for her to grab the rocking chair and pull it closer. It had a dark green seat cushion on it. One of the original four had lay back down and closed her eyes. I leaned over and asked if she was okay. She didn't respond. I told the new three about the other four of us having similar dream symbols during our nap. Two of the three that had just joined us said they had the same thing. The one lying down now sat back up and said she had just lain down for a few moments to try to capture more of the dream. She said she needed to make a phone call ASAP. I told her we would take a break in just a few minutes. We started talking about the dream having some message about Christmas. Myself and a member of JLWA were both single and had very similar feelings and experiences about Christmas over the last few years. We have both lost our joy in the seasonal celebrations and events. We quit watching the holiday shows, and quit going to parties and community events. We discussed that we should do those things together. That we should both try to be the force behind the other when we don't feel like doing something we know we used to enjoy so much. Even if it is just watching TV specials together. I felt as though I was begging her to do this. She agreed that we should but did not agree to do so. A reporter walked in the room and wanted to know if she could observe and take notes. I made sure it was okay with everyone else. I told her we were getting ready to take a five-minute break and then we would reconvene. She seemed irritated. I was trying to be pleasant and told her that one of the women needed to make a phone call at this time and another needed something else and we would keep the break as brief as possible. She still seemed irritated and that irritated me. I didn't have to let her observe after all. As it turned out when we did try to reconvene the reporter had left because we had taken too long. We decided to call it a night. I was still trying to partner with me in a holiday effort but did not get a commitment from her. I was thinking about all the things that I could do myself to try to work towards my personal holiday goals.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-06-29),-0.18212692,0.03615257
452,"I was in my townhouse, but it had an attic. I was cleaning out this attic. I wanted to get things ready to take to Mother and Daddy's to take to a garage sale. In this attic it had very, very high ceiling. It reminded me of the storeroom of a retail store, where it had shelves, maybe five high and on all four walls. Each of the shelves were pretty high and there was a lot of space in between the shelves so it had a lot of high things. Some of the things were very tall. I was deciding to get rid of so much stuff. There were 10-12 different sewing machines. I was commenting to someone on how I had all of my different sewing machines, from the first one that I learned to sew on through to the current one that I use now. I decided that I wasn't going to price anything for the garage sale. I wanted Mother and Daddy to just let people make an offer and they could decide if that was fair. I didn't want to take the time to put prices on everything because I had so much stuff. As we were getting this stuff down and carrying it out, I went out and saw that Daddy had set up to have the garage sale right there because there was so much. But at this point it seemed to be not at my townhouse. Maybe at my birth home but that doesn't seem right either. He had set up the garage sale in all these different rooms and different areas outside. He had gone ahead and priced things as we had carried them out to him. As we were taking things down off these shelves that I either didn't know were there or I had forgotten were there. So there were things that I was deciding to keep or that I had set out for the garage sale but then I changed my mind and decided that I didn't want to sell them after all. I brought those things back in. The things were primarily antiques or had an antique appearance. In fact, I commented to someone that these were the kinds of things I look for when I go to the antique mall. When we were close to having everything out there, I went out and started shopping at my own garage sale. When I added up the prices of everything that I wanted to keep it was around $1100. I asked someone if we really had to pay for our own things, for the things that we decided we didn't want to sell. So, I was carrying the things that I wanted to keep back inside. At that point, it seems that maybe there were things there that other people were selling as well. This makes sense in the context of my earlier question. I had found quite a few Native American things. jewelry, a headpiece with feathers. I said, That's what I needed for my SAID costume. I'm going to go ahead and buy it or keep it so I have it the next time I wear that costume. There were also two small stools. They were square, wood, painted blue, but also had something else painted on them like flowers or stencils. I decided to keep them so I could refinish them and keep them. There were also some very pretty porcelain things but I don't really know what they were or what they were for. There were quite a few porcelain things that I was going to sell and someone told me what they were but I don't remember now. I also realized as I was cleaning this out that some of the things had been left there by a previous owner. So I was debating if it was alright for me to keep the profit from those things. There was also a lot, a lot of stuff animals. I was just running my arm along the shelves and just knocking them all to the floor. Towards the end, one of the very top shelves still had some things on it, I was trying to get them down myself but I was afraid I was going to fall or break some of the things so I realized I had to wait until Matthew came back, then I could ask him to get those things. We left. I don't know who we is. For some reason, I don't know if we left and were going home. As I was looking around at the things that I had carried out there, the things that were for sale, I also found some Native American jewelry that I was going to buy. But after I gathered up all the things that I was going to keep or buy and saw the total, I started reevaluating and putting some things back since it was around $1100. Even though I didn't know how much of that I was actually going to have to pay since most of the things were mine. I carried the things of my own that I wanted to keep back inside. It seems there was also something to do with taking showers, or taking turns taking showers. Figuring out who was going to take a shower when.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-07-14),-0.23695856,0.0014080033
455,I was at a Harris family reunion with Bill C. He proposed to me. He was sitting at a table and I was standing next to him. There was a single red rose there and a piece of chocolate cake. He started talking about depending on me and something else. He dug his fingers down into the chocolate cake and pulled out an engagement ring. He was licking the chocolate cake off of it. I made a comment about our mutual love of chocolate. The ring was a very unusual shape. It was large and had a very high setting. A piece of the setting on the top also jutted out to the side. I don't know how to describe it nor do I have a very clear picture of it anymore. After that I was talking to various family members and they were saying how much they liked him.

I was talking to him but I was also outside with his wife, talking to her while she hung laundry on the clothesline. Primarily what I noticed her hanging was underwear. It didn't really bother me but I thought Terry might be embarrassed by that. Later we were in their town. He and some other woman were showing me around town. They had all of these underground passages, where you could walk around town and be safe from the elements. You wouldn't have to be cold or hot or get wet or anything. We were talking about the pros and cons of that versus walking around outdoors. Carriage rides wouldn't be as much fun there. But it was nice not to have to deal with very cold weather. It was as though all four sides of these passages were all brick. but a finished brick that was very smooth to the touch and very pretty colors. Yellow is the color I remember. They weren't just straight walkways. Some of them curved and some were hilly, for lack of a better word. I was with Bob F and we had these little cars on a sort of map. We were racing our cars and the map or path was very windy and such. These little cars had things sticking out from the bottom, similar to toy racecars my brothers had when they were younger. This map had a track. I was automatically going to win because I was in front of his four cars. It was just one lane.

465,"Jo V moved in with me at 2 am one morning. I didn't realize that she had until someone told me. It seems as though I went to the backroom, of the show Cheers. Carla came back. It was really a mess. There was stuff everywhere, stuff all over the floor, paper all over the floor. I was trying to clean up and Carla was trying to help me. There were playing cards all over the floor. She was picking them up and putting them together. I said, No. No. There are different kinds so we have to sort them by deck. We started sorting them. Now we were in this large house. It was an older house, very cool house, with many rooms. I went to this one room that was being used for storage. I could hardly get the door open. There were all kinds of Mickey Mouse and Walt Disney things in there. I thought it was very cool. I suggested to someone that we should use it to create a Mickey Mouse Room or something similar. When I heard that Jo V had moved in, I went back to that room with the intention of clearing it out for Jo V to move into. She had already done that. It looked very nice. She had set up her computer equipment in a big, open room. It had three tables, set together in u formation. She had at least one very unusual piece. It was a rectangular computer screen, I think. Very long but not very high. There were several children. Jo V and I were showing them something on the computer. There was something about these children needing to go to bed or go to sleep. There was also something about criminals. Maybe they once owned the house and were now trying to get it back but weren't able to. At one point I may have been a teenager.

486,"I was working at the CAS office, though it looked differently than it does in waking life. I had rearranged the space after Cole P and Terry D had left. I hung a large number of pictures on several of the walls. They went from midway up the wall almost to the ceiling in most areas. I had also moved my workspace to a different location. Cole P and Terry came in and were looking at the changes I made. They asked some questions about the pictures on the walls. I explained to them briefly what the pictures were and why they were where they were. I recognize that there were many pictures of me. not me by myself but of me with other people. I was explaining to them that these were pictures from my previous work experiences. As I was saying that, when we were standing in front of one wall, I realized that I wasn't being very honest with them about that one section. It occurred to me how many pictures of me were hanging there. Because I didn't want to give a bad impression, I explained to them that the one section of pictures was of past work experiences, when I don't think they really were. But I said it because it felt more valid to me to have them there if they were of past work experiences. I seemed to be taking care of some walk-in clients or customers while they were there. We got interrupted so I had to go take care of the client. I went to a desk that was not mine, got what I needed and took care of the client. I went back to Cole P and Terry. They were bringing things in for donation, so it now feels like NTNS. They were bringing in small piles of things and setting them on a table. Terry pointed out that one row of items were his. He said something about keeping them separate because of his wife and her wanting him to keep his things separate from Cole P. I then went back to my own desk to be able to take care of another client. I realized that while I liked my desk in the new area, purely from an aesthetic point of view, it was not going to be as convenient for taking care of clients. There was a difference in attitudes between Cole P and Terry. Maybe there were some hard feelings on Cole P's part because he may have had the sense that his departure wasn't totally his decision. He had felt the pressure, knew that Bill C was not satisfied with his performance. So even though he resigned, it may have been to avoid being fired.

When people came in and got settled I was going to first of all helping them to fill out their entry forms. for lack of a better word. I don't know what it was. I had some 3 x 5 cards. It would say something like, #1 and what it was. Then I would tell them what they should be filling in there. Like, a lot of them were just general what they should be filling in but some were very specific. So on some of them I was telling them a specific name to check or fill in. One of the items I didn't know what it was. It was a very strange word. It sounded something like, Imagonnagohome! So I was standing on this stage with a microphone. I was joking about it.

492,"I had this little thing that I was using for transportation. The thing that I was using was about 8-12 inches off the ground. It might have been two feet long and about a foot wide. You would wonder how anyone could possible sit on something with these dimensions but I was. It was white and it felt kind of like cement. It was shaped like a bread pan. hollow in the center. I put the open end on the bottom and I put a folded piece of fabric on the top to make it softer to sit on. It had a remote control that I used to propel it. It didn't seem to have a motor or anything so I don't know how the remote control could propel it but it did. I took it to a repair shop because it wasn't going as fast as it normally does. They were good-naturedly teasing or enjoying that I had this mode of transportation. The woman that checked me in, instead of writing up a ticket and giving it to the men to be repaired, she somehow repaired it herself. I don't think she even charged me for it. It seems that it was a very minor repair. While I was waiting I was wondering if I should get something else, like a moped. I knew that wasn't really what I wanted. I didn't want a two-wheel vehicle. A moped would be too much like a motorcycle for my taste. Then I realized that what would be ideal for me would be one of these scooters that they sell for people with physical problems getting around. I put it back on the ground and put my bundle of fabric on it and sat back down on it. It's so small I can't figure out how I could sit on it, keep my feet off the ground, keep my balance, or anything. I got on it. I was inside a building. I started going. I was going pretty fast, comparatively, through this building. I was turning corners very quickly and going through doors quickly. I was going so fast that I was concerned that I might fall off when making the turns. At this point I was in a YMCA. The children were watching me on it and they were pointing it out to their parents. saying how cool it was and that it would be even better than a skateboard. I am in the YMCA. I am sitting on a sofa next to Barry C. It seems that we're waiting on someone. He's trying to read the newspaper. It appears that he has Parkinson's Disease. It's what my parents generation used to call Palsy. He's trying to read the paper but he's shaking so much that he can't read it. he can't hold it still enough. I can tell he is getting very frustrated. I don't know if it is hands or his head that is shaking so much. I reach up to try to give his head something to lean against so it wouldn't be shaking so much. He jerked away from me. I thought, oh, he doesn't like that because it looked odd. Maybe if I just lean up against him so it will look like he is just resting his head against mine. When I tried to do that he pulled away again and looked at me as if to say, what are you doing? I said, I thought I would just give you a head to rest against. He didn't say anything but I could tell he didn't want to do that. Someone is giving a tour of the facilities. They are getting ready to do some major renovations and they are taking people on tours to show them what they are going to be doing. I went on the tour. We went through a couple of rooms. We also went to this outdoor space. It reminded me of a garden area - not a vegetable garden. more like a flower garden area, though not really that either. I went back inside. There were children all over the place. obviously. They were having a lot of fun. There were a lot of very unusual rooms. I don't want to say childlike. because they weren't childlike in a toddler kind of way. They were simply very fun looking rooms. Some of the children were smaller, 8- 10, and others were closer to teen years. I was wondering why Matthew didn't spend more time here when he was younger. I would think that he would have really enjoyed it. Some of the entrances weren't typical doors. You had to climb up on something and be able to keep your balance while you got the door open. There wasn't a door handle from the inside so I had to grab the bottom of the door and pull it close enough to me so I could grab the hook for the latchhook. I think I had a pillow and blanket that I was carrying with me while I was trying to get up and through this door. I wanted a drink of water so I went back outside to the garden area. There was an old-fashioned water pump that tapped into a natural spring. I decided to go over there to get a drink but I didn't. I did think that I would go tell Barry C that it was there. I don't remember much about what the rooms looked like. The one room, there seemed to be two doors that were white but they were trimmed in red. a pattern painted on them in red. There were two teenage girls running through that door. They were giggling and squealing the way girls that age do.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-09-29),-0.25662473,0.063814685
494,"A family member or a friend and myself were visiting some people in another town. I don't know the name of the town or even what state it was in. At one point during the dream it was winter and there was a lot of snow on the ground. While we were at this house, the wife was telling us about some chairs that her husband makes that are so soft and comfortable to sit in. She said people just love them. There was a pile of different size cushions sitting on the floor. Some were as small as 6 x 6. Others were large. the size of a regular chair cushion. She was explaining how her husband uses these different sizes to fit them in the frames of these chairs. I had grabbed one of the large ones and two of the small ones and was trying to find different ones that would work well to fill up the seat frame of this chair, but they didn't. Then, either someone told me or I realized that I was using the wrong thing. There were bundles of fabric sitting there. The fabrics were all accordion folded and then banded together so they would stay together. I don't know what they were banded with. The fabric itself felt really soft, like cashmere. They were different colors. They reminded me of winter scarves. I learned that was what he used to make these chairs. He just fit these bundles of fabric together. So, I started doing that, using those. They were different sizes and different colors. With those I was able to make a cushion of sorts on the seat frame of this chair. I commented that they reminded me of Matthew's red winter scarf, how they felt and how they looked. The chairs didn't have much of a back on them. The back was maybe only 6-8 inches high. I wondered how that would be comfortable. There was something besides just the frame but I don't know what or how. After I did get the frame of the chair filled in I sat down on it. It was comfortable. With the back the way it was it surprised me that it was as comfortable as it was. I don't know that it was as soft or as comfortable as I expected it to be from what I had been told. But it was comfortable. It struck me as odd that that was how he made these chairs. that he didn't use any kind of covering for these bundles of fabric. He just put those in there and that was that. There was someplace that I either needed to go, wanted to go, or simply decided to go to. I asked someone to give me a ride and then did. I don't remember where it was. After I was ready to return I just walked. I realized that it was just about a two-block walk and that it was silly for me to have someone drive me there previously. It wasn't snowing then. The weather was nice. I don't remember it being cold. I was back at the house and I decided it was time to go. Whoever it was that was with me, family member or friend, - we got ready to go and they and I disagreed on the path to get home. the route we needed to take to get home. They were going to go one way and I was going to go another. Somehow we kept ending up at the same place. either because we couldn't get through the way we wanted. I was standing there and there was a local town person there telling us to wait for this small train. I don't know if we missed the train or if the train neglected to stop. It was now snowing and the weather was really bad. The train was the type of train that you might see in an amusement park. it reminded me of the old train at Lesourdesville Lake.",elizabeth.tsv,(2002-10-04),-0.07245008,0.1030551
498,"This is very sketchy but important. It had something to do with the CAS office. My sense is that there were people who came to work there but either decided that they couldn't do the job, so they left, simply because they knew they couldn't or because they knew they couldn't and they wanted to make the decision to leave before they were asked to leave. There were people who couldn't do the job and were asked to leave, or maybe it was suggested that they leave. It wasn't the typical office setting. I have this picture in my mind of people along two opposing walls. They aren't really standing in a row. they are but there is a significant space between each one. as though there is a room for a desk between each of them. They are just standing there. I don't remember any furniture in the room. It seems that it had something to do with changing clothes. Maybe I was changing clothes. I realized. Or. I don't know. For some reason I'm noticing about the fact that I have shaved off my pubic hair.

503,I was going shopping. I was Christmas shopping. I was looking for an electronic item for Matthew. I ran into Darren at the store. I invited him to walk with me and look too. He did. While we were looking in the display cases I found this game. It was like a maze in a plastic case. You had a magnetic thing that sat on top that you used to move a piece inside around the maze. like a steel ball. I think this was something to do with Batman. The magnet moved Batman through the maze. I asked Darren if he remembered those things from when we were younger. He said he did. I stood there a played with it for a minute and decided it was much too easy for Matthew. I had gone there to look for something very specific. Darren said he was going to go look at something else. I noticed these tall wide walls of jewelry. I decided to go look at it for myself. I knew I shouldn't be spending money on myself right now so I decided to just see if there was anything on clearance. I don't think I saw anything.,elizabeth.tsv,(2002-12-07),-0.16530775,0.03293511

As I was doing so it occurred to me how long we would be gone. Maybe it meant we were going to be gone over the Holiday. I stopped packing and was rethinking my decision. I was trying to decide if I really wanted to do that. It might have had to do with the fact that I wasn't sure if I could take a week off work.

516,"I was at the CAS offices, though they looked different than in waking life. There were several offices. I was sharing an office with Bill C. There was a salesperson name Mike [unknown] that was leaving our employment. He decided that it had been too long since he sold anything and decided it was time for him to move on. He was in his office. He had lots of boxes and was putting his personal belongings in them. I was wondering why Bill C had not told me that Mike was leaving. There were two offices or rooms that were full of extra furniture. Some of it was quite nice. Some of it was quite old, like the old green and gray metal desks. I was looking around thinking that now that Mike was leaving we could each have our own office. I wanted my own office, and yet I realized that working in the same office as Bill C was nice because I could ask him questions quite easily. I can ask him things as they come to mind as opposed to creating a list or having a pile of stuff for him. I was debating if that was what I really wanted to do, yet it somehow felt as though I didn't really have a choice. That is what we were really going to do. I was in one of these rooms with all this furniture in it. I was moving things around. I was debating about switching my furniture to something nicer that I saw in one of these rooms. There was something about Haley N and me sharing an office now. Of course, I did NOT want that. I think that's when I had the idea that we had the space now for each member of the staff to have their own office. Yet, still that it was convenient for me to share an office with Bill C. I was also thinking about the fact that we had all this extra furniture there. It was probably stuff that we would never use. It was just taking up space and it was just messy-filling up both rooms the way it was. There was no rhyme or reason to the way that it was in the rooms. It looked as though someone had just arrived it in and sat it anywhere. It was all sitting at different angles and such. I started moving some things around and I was going to try to organize the rooms a little bit. There were all kinds of different pieces, like different types of desks and different types of bookshelves. While I was moving this stuff around I also came upon these things that were shaped like hearts. They were probably about 3 ft x 3 ft. I'm not sure what they were made out of. I don't think they were all made out of the same thing. There were a bunch of them that seemed to be made out of Mylar - silver Mylar. I was trying to gather them up and put them in a nice neat pile. Bill C's wife came in. She was talking about all of this furniture. Then Bill C came in and was helping. He started moving things around. It was very easy for him - as though the furniture weighed ounces rather than pounds. He would pick up two or three pieces at a time and move it.

520,"I was with Bill F, Brian F, Bob F, Daddy, and Matthew. Matthew was only 9 or 10 years old. We went someplace to eat, like a Hardee's. Right inside the door were platters of food on each side of the door. We were to choose what we wanted from these trays. It seemed that they were sitting on top of the trashcans that you typically find in this type of restaurant. We each got a plate and started choosing what we wanted. Matthew and one of the others would take a fork and take something off the platter and put it straight in their mouth. I told them to quit doing that because it was very bad manners. I told them that they need to put it on their plates and then eat it when we get to the table. We went to find a table. We found two tables that we could push together so we could eat. We had stopped so Matthew could use the bathroom, but now he had to go again. He and I both decided to leave and go find a bathroom. Daddy was upset that we were going to be gone so long because it was going to take us 2 hours. I told one of the others that this was perfectly reasonable, that we couldn't do it in less time. We went ahead and left. Now we were helping Matthew move into his dorm. It didn't look like his waking life dorm.

They were really incredible looking apartments. They were maybe three stories. Contemporary yet with a classic elegance. One room was a media room. This one room appeared to be two stories high. It was all white. One of the tall white walls was to be used for projection. I knew that even if we could figure out a way to afford the rent we could not afford to furnish it properly. I said this to Darren, I believe more than once. I was also thinking to myself that I didn't know if it was right to commit to an apartment like this when I wasn't sure that our marriage would work out.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-02-07),-0.06587624,0.052783024
529,"I think I must have been living in St. Joe, with Mother and Daddy. I had just spent some time with some of the men from high school. I know Dwight W and Albert S were there. Dwight W was coming on to me and I said something about him coming on to some many different women. He wanted me to believe that his interest was sincere. I knew better. They were getting together the next day for something. They found out that I had a delivery pizza business and ordered six pizzas from me for the next day. The next day I was busy making this pizza. Some of them started out as balls of dough that I shaped and prepared. Others looked like mini-pizzas, of various sizes, that I had to slowly move around the edges to stretch out. They had already been baked but were not brown around the edges. I would get one the right size and put it in the oven for just a few minutes until the edges browned, while I worked on the next one. I kept stacking them one on top of the other and repeating this process. I was concerned that the ones on the bottom might get to brown or become overdone but then decided that was not the case. As soon as they were finished I wanted to hurry to get them delivered while they were still hot. Someone, I think Matthew, was helping me to get everything to my car. One of the things we were taking to the car was a white ice cube holder. We had put something in it. One of the things was a glass of Diet Sprite for me. It didn't have a lid and I wanted to be careful not to spill it. When I got ready to leave I was having some difficulty with the car. It was either not stopping, not steering properly. I put it in reverse to try to fix the problem and the car sped backwards toward the garage. Mother was having a garage sale. She looked up but didn't realize what was going on and that I nearly crashed into the garage/sale. There was a child sitting in a highchair that recognized what had happened and looked at me like boy you were lucky! I put the car in forward and left. It seemed to be driving fine now. I wondered if I would remember the directions to where I was going. I arrived at a dirt lane. I found A's house and told him I had the pizza. He told me someone should have called and told me that they had cancelled the order. I was thinking about the payment and somehow realized or found out that they had prepaid and now wanted their money back because they had called to cancel. I think I may have gone somewhere else because now I was talking to Andy and he said he had paid me cash. I don't remember giving him his money back. I went back home and was looking through my phone order book. I was quite upset to learn that over the last week or so quite a few people had called in orders for pizza, all orders for one pizza, and I had not known about them and consequently not filled the orders. I was thinking about how bad this was for my business reputation. These people would be hesitant to order from me again. I was looking at the names of the people in the house who had taken the orders. I wanted to blame them for not telling me but realized that I only had myself to blame for not checking the order book and checking with other people on a regular basis. However, I also thought that, being a new business, it would have been considerate for them to point out to me that they had taken these orders until the business achieved a more regular rhythm. Otherwise, I would have to check the order book every few minutes to see if I had missed a call - so I could fill it on a timely basis. The people in St. Joe liked that there was now a pizza delivery place but I could lose the business quickly if they decided that I was unreliable.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-02-07),-0.20963888,0.022679163

539,"I was with Matthew at PLU. We were driving around campus. There were street flags hanging on every block, maybe 2 or 3 on each block. Each flag was advertising 4-6 things on campus. The flags were green and had two different colors of lettering. Some of the words were in a brighter color than the others. I think there was someone else in the car with us. I asked how students would know something, though I don't remember what, about the difference in the words on the flags. They said by the brighter color. Now I was with Matthew in a store on campus. He was going to be putting up one of the Christmas trees on campus. He had a tree, some silver garland, and some grapefruit-sized orange ornaments in a shopping cart. I didn't want to say much because I knew he probably wanted to make the decisions about how to do the tree but I also wanted him to think through what he needed. I asked him if he was going to put garland on the tree, even though I saw it in the cart. It didn't look to me like he had enough. When I asked he lifted up the garland from the cart and I saw he had plenty. Then I asked him if he was going to do the whole tree in orange ornaments. Again he lifted some things from the cart but this time he saw that he didn't have enough ornaments. We went down another aisle and found maybe two more groups of orange ornaments. The one group he was looking at actually looked like oranges. They appeared to have a long, 5-6 inch stem on them that was a hook shape on the end that you would use to hang them on the tree. Matthew picked one of them up and was looking at it. We realized that they actually had orange juice in them. I said that was a cool idea since there were so many viruses going around, they would be pretty on the tree plus they would serve the students well.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-02-14),-0.19427699,0.10215389
540,"I had gone back to visit the home of my grandparents. Several of my childhood friends were there. We were in the backyard and we were talking about these sticks that we used to find in the yard and play with. I said something about one of them having a vanilla like substance in it. I was still curious what that substance was and I was still curious to actually squeeze some out and taste it to see if it really tasted like vanilla. A couple people went to the far back section of the yard to collect a couple of these sticks. Now, the sticks were very large wood poles, almost like telephone poles but not as tall. They were standing vertically, leaning against something. The people who had gone to collect some knocked most of them down and emerged from behind them. They were ducking and laughing. They returned to where the rest of us were still sitting in the grass. Now the sticks were small branches as they were when we were children. Someone broke one of the sticks and squeezed something out of it. There was popcorn lying in the grass so they squeezed whatever it was all over the popcorn. It came out like clear syrup - almost like corn syrup. But it turned a light brown, almost caramel color, as it coated the popcorn. We all bravely agreed to taste it. Someone else, older than us, walked up and said something about our curiosity finally having us do this. We mostly just smiled as we tasted the now coated popcorn. He said, see, it tastes like caramel doesn't it? We agreed that it did. I still wanted to find the ones with the vanilla like substance. I found one and began to squeeze the substance out. It was white and creamy. I only squeezed a little bit out, touched it with my finger, and tasted it. It did taste like vanilla. Now we were at a building on the property that housed this huge old clock. The clock could only be seen from the inside though. When I opened the door there were 5 or 6 large wood pieces hanging from the ceiling. The building was only big enough for these. It was not a building you could walk into. Each wood piece was very tall, about 18 inches deep and maybe 6 inches wide. They had been constructed into a box shape with four pieces of wood. The one farthest to my left had a clock face on the left of its two widest surfaces. We were being told about the mystery of this clock. It apparently had something to do with me and if anything were ever to happen to me, something would happen to this clock, or vice versa. Later, I could see that the clock face was gone, but I don't think I was actually present. It seems more like I'm watching a movie at this point. I think I am now a child and I'm in a carriage, of sorts, with some other people and they are rushing me to the clockhouse. They are going to open the wood piece housing the clock and stand me inside. The purpose is either to save the clock or me. It feels that it is both. If I become sick or something happens to me, then something also happens to the clock. By putting me in the clock house I am restored to well being and the beautiful clock face returns as well. Now I am with a man, maybe my husband. We are in a restaurant. He is holding some kind of a trophy while singing and dancing. I was little embarrassed and several of us were kind of laughing about his actions. We were enjoying this aspect of his personality, at the same time we did want him to sit down. We left the restaurant but I don't know where we were going. The man is riding on the outside of a vehicle. Again this is like a scene from a movie. The vehicle he is on is trying to catch up to a larger vehicle and he is going to try to jump from on to the other. There seems to be an urgent purpose in this whole scenario. Just as they catch up to the larger vehicle and he prepares to jump he transforms into a small boy. He seems to be going in slow-motion as he jumps, and just as he reaches for the bar on the outside of the other vehicle, time speeds up again and he grabs the bar and lands where he intended. Now that he has turned into a small boy we realize we must take him to the clock house to turn him back into a man. There was more to this. I was in the house, at least once, with several other adults. I think they were only women. Maybe they were my sisters.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-02-14),-0.02039302,0.008676298

Terri O thought it might be a problem when they realized the event was curriculum related. She wrote someone a note about a hypothetical situation, because she didn't want to point out the misunderstanding until she realized that everything would still work out okay. Now it seems that at least some of CIISC were there already. I asked Mary Kay C and Karyn L where they were headed from there, to Wisconsin or Oregon. some of us, all women, are in swimsuits in a facility that looks like a YMCA. We are outside at a pond. Paige, from the TV show Trading Spaces is there. We are instructed to reach inside alligator's mouths to find food. Paige has her hand deep inside the mouth of an alligator and is saying, look, my alligator doesn't seem to mind at all. She is twisting his jaws and playing around. But no one seems to be finding anything. Then a man, someone trained for this type of thing, comes up and puts his hand even deeper down the mouth of the alligator Paige had. I was remembering something I saw on TV where a contestant had to go into a murky pond and try to dig something she couldn't even see out of the mud. The pond had five crocodiles in it and there was a sharpshooter standing by the edge of the pond prepared to shoot the crocodile if she got in trouble. I wanted to know the difference between alligator's and crocodiles. Someone said you can do things underwater and alligator's won't bother you but crocodiles will. Now we were inside, some of us were sitting waiting on others. We were still in our swimsuits. I had my jeans with me and was thinking about pulling them on while I was waiting. When the others came we headed to the locker room. I couldn't remember which locker was mine. I knew the general vicinity and that it was next to Susan J's but that was all. There was a young girl with us and she began opening lockers a little bit to try to help me find mine. I told her not to do that because we shouldn't be opening other people's lockers. I noticed one wasn't closed properly because their clothes were caught in the door. I pushed the clothes in for them so the door would close properly. When the young girl was opening the lockers she saw a bag of snack chips and wanted some but I told her no because they belonged to someone else. I asked Susan J if she remembered which locker was hers. I knew I would be able to find mine then since I knew mine was right next to hers.

People would come up and hand us their money and then go on to the carnival. It seems that maybe it was a penny a person to enter. I don't anything about the carnival or anything like that.

At the last minute I thought we should have two trays so I was quickly trying to divide the money for another tray. We were only doing this for a couple of hours in the evening.

I guess there were members of the family that should have been there helping me. I just kept busy cleaning up. I was imagining someone saying something to me and I would respond, well, there was stuff to do so I was keeping busy. There was something about something sitting there that needed to be cleaned up.

There was one woman in attendance that I recognized as someone that was supposed to be in our group originally but couldn't for some reason. Initially we were each to introduce ourselves and tell a little bit about ourselves. I said very little when it was my turn because I didn't want to tell these strangers very much about myself. Someone told me I should tell them about my name change. I did so in a humorous manner, saying, Elizabeth H enrolled in the program but Anna F is taking it. I went on to say something to the effect that they should watch out if they ever meet Anna- as though she is the evil alter ego. Some people were just looking at me as though they were totally confused and others laughed. As the discussion continued, it seemed that one or two of the men were primary figures in the other group. I had the impression that throughout the semester they would go into another room to get props whenever they wanted to, to get things to support their discussion. I thought that was a nice benefit they had. I was sitting next to Garnet P. I asked her if she goes to Tuesday morning classes because I was surprised that I had never seen or never noticed her there. She said that herself and another woman never go. They couldn't work it out with their schedule so they have only been attending small group sessions. I left the group and was headed out to the parking lot. I was carrying a box but I don't know what it had it in. It was about the size of a layer cake.

I told her I was going outside because my car was parked at the front door and I had to move it. I said I would just meet her there. There was quite a bit of snow outside, though it was in the melting stage and alot of it looked very dirty. I pulled my car into an angled parking space but not in the way someone would normally do that. I think I entered from a strange angle. I was debating whether to reposition my car, move, or leave it there. As I was thinking about this another car pulled in next to me. I finally decided to move. I pulled out and was going to try another odd maneuver and thought to myself, Yeah. Right! Like I should really do this with this car.

It had a dark colored carpet. Three of the walls were dark paneling. The other wall had a very dark wallpaper. I had put up nails and hung some things. At another point I had taken them all down. I can't remember if I was having my office redecorated or if I was moving into another office. I had taken everything off the walls then I decided to take all the nails out of the wall. I was just reaching up and pull them out with my hand. Some of them, the nails had been put in these holes. They were maybe an inch or inch and a half in diameter and equally deep. The nail had been put into the wall directly in the middle of that hole. Haley N had gone out and bought some live plants that were on sale. They didn't look very good at all. They weren't healthy. They were small and scraggly. She had also bought macrame plant hangers in different colors and different color combinations. One was a pale yellow with maybe white and rust color design in it. I was hanging those plants and trying to decide which hanger would go best where. The flowerpots themselves were very dirty so I had to wash them off. That is when I was thinking that she had gotten these plants on sale and had not spent much money on them. That's why they looked so bad. I didn't think it was that big of a deal. I was just surprised that she had bought something on sale that she had bought plants that looked like that. It just surprised me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-06),-0.21903229,0.079987384
593,"I was living at the house on Lakeland Dr. I was in CI with some of my CRHP sisters. We were at an event. I had put together a video. At lunchtime we were eating some soup I had made. I had gotten the recipe from a previous CRHP group, from a book or video they had put together. Everyone loved the soup. I said one of the reasons I liked it so much is that it reminded me of summer. It had sliced bananas, kiwis, and other fruits in it. Maybe it was a cold soup. It was very pretty. As we were talking about this soup I realized that I had neglected to give appropriate credit for the recipe in the video and that I would have to edit for that. I went in to the house of the woman who was duplicating the video. I wondered why someone outside of our CRHP group was duplicating it. I realized I was going to have to edit the master video and then the ones that she had already duplicated. I went back to my house for some reason. I was walking. When I got to my street there were large boxes scattered around the street about midway to my house. When I got closer to them I realized they were all for me. I choose one that was nearest to the middle of the street and drug it to the sidewalk and then drug it the rest of the way home along the sidewalk. Once or twice I veered off the sidewalk and then got back on it. When I got to my driveway I noticed rows of grass growing up through the cement driveway. I drug the box up the driveway and just then realized that I left my keys back at CI. I would have to walk all the way back to get my keys. I realized it would take me about 15 minutes. Now there were two of my CRHP sisters there. They were going that way too but they were going to run. I had a plastic tumbler with something to drink in it. I was finishing my drink and telling them to wait for me, that I would run with them. As we began to run I was finishing my drink and telling them that I wouldn't be able to keep up because I'm not a runner, but I was going to try anyway.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-26),-0.15259041,0.011773138
594,"I was on the TV show The West Wing, but we were actually in the White House. We all believed we were actually the White House staff. It was the holidays and we were sitting in a room that had tables and chairs but it wasn't a meeting room, kitchen, or dining room. We were sitting at tables and chairs and we were all getting ready to leave to go on various trips to various places. Maybe we were headed home for the Holidays. Donna brought out two very large suitcases. CJ was teasing her or something about her suitcases. Donna got very defensive. CJ said, the thing that really gets me is the security tags on the luggage. Donna said something to the effect of these days you can't be too careful or something about the hassle of traveling by air these days. I don't know what these security tags were or what their purpose was. The one suitcase in particular, the largest one, was lying on its side and she had a coat laying on it. The President was coming down a wide, white set of stairs. He was wearing a white suit. He started running down the steps and fell. He ended up sliding down the rest of the steps on the seat of his pants. He was laughing. He bumped his nose so he was holding his nose. When he hit the bottom of the steps he started running. Someone was kind of chasing after him. They were just playing around. Someone had said some kind of nursery rhyme about first one to the buffet. Then they said something to him about running and sliding down the steps that way. He said, I can't help myself. Whenever I hear that rhyme, and he repeated it, I just have to be the first one to the buffet. A bunch of us were sitting together, again at tables but in a different place. CJ and Toby were sitting across from each other. CJ was bemoaning the fact that she wasn't in a relationship. Toby kind of started flirting with her. They went back and forth a bit. Then they stood up and each leaned across the table. They were going to kiss. I don' t know if they actually did. As I was sitting there listening to this and observing I was thinking, Why her? Why not me? Why is it never me?",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-27),-0.116862744,0.1606464
595,"I was working at the CAS office. We had a special event going on, but I'm not sure where we were holding it. Bill C had hired three more people. One was a woman around my age. She had black hair and was about the same size and height as me. Another was a woman, probably in her early 20's, with shoulder-length black hair, thin and very pretty. The other was a man in his early 20's, somewhat short, thin, with dark hair. The young woman was in front of the group with another woman, speaking to the audience. It wasn't until later that she was working for CAS. I was sitting in the audience with the other woman. Later, the four of us are sitting together in the audience, talking. I was thinking about how great it was that I was getting along so well with these two women. The young man I could tell was going to be a troublemaker. He was sharing Bill C's office space and he felt that gave him a distinct advantage over the rest of us. He kept saying he felt bad for us that Bill C was giving him such special treatment, asking him to do certain things rather than asking the rest of us, just because he was working in that space. I patted him on the knee and said, trust me. I've had my turn being the office lackey. The things he was referring to were the kinds of things an office lackey would do. He made some comment to insinuate that I misunderstood or didn't know what I was talking about. I am looking out a window. There is a clown or some such person out there with some fireworks. He waves to a child standing inside to come out and join him. The child goes out and takes a lit firework item from the clown and throws it into a moving limousine. I was concerned for two reasons. One is that it was dangerous but the other that I thought the limousine was carrying some of our clients coming to our program. It turned out that Santa Claus and some other people were in the limousine. They all jumped out and were running around yelling. Santa's beard was on fire. I seemed more concerned about how setting Santa's beard on fire would affect this child.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-05-30),-0.29406458,0.023609307

When I did it, it actually created a worse problem and it looked like a mini-Niagara falls in two different places. They weren't very high but very wide. The water was just gushing out like you would see at a water fall like that. BJ was at the house and I said, Quick we need to go call maintenance and get them over here right away.

611,"I was at an SAID conference. We were at a large, very nice hotel. It was getting close to time for the Conference Gala. I had been taking pictures throughout the conference. I offered to take pictures of someone in their costume before they arrived at the ball simply because their costume was such that it would only be fully appreciated in a picture. Someone overheard me make this offer so they asked me to also come to their room and take a picture of them in their costume. So I agreed to do this. I went to her room. Her roommate had described the costume to me as having vines all over her. When I got to her room and saw here costume, I saw that the only vine was on the back in a scallop shape hanging from her shoulders. That was it. Otherwise the outfit was a dressy, white, chiffon, pant and top. She was a woman not much older than I was and very attractive, maybe in her mid to late fifties. Her hotel room was very large. I was looking for the best vantage point to take her picture. Then was one place in the room that had a recessed ceiling light. I suggested she stand right under that light. I thought it would give a very nice effect. I had alot of trouble getting her in the right position. She didn't seem to understand my directions or she would decide on her own to move. I was having trouble getting shots that didn't have hotel furniture like the bed in the shot. I took a couple of pictures and then I stepped outside her room. There was a beautiful courtyard. One wall had alot of beautiful dark wood. There was alot of green. The floors were a beautiful green. I don't know if it was flooring or grass. I said, Let's take some out here. This would be beautiful. We went out there. I got very close and got ready to take a shot. I looked away and looked back and saw that she had moved very far away from the camera. I said, Why did you do that? Why did you move far away? She said, Because I told you I want some full body shots. I said, Yes. But as far away as you moved you will be about this big in the picture. I held up my hand and my thumb and forefinger were about an inch apart. I said, I don't think that's what you want. You can't hardly see that you're there. She kind of shrugged her shoulders and nodded her head yes, that she understood. I repositioned her up close. I said, Now, I'm only going to take one or two more because I'm running out of film. So this is going to be it. As I was taking those pictures I saw her soon to be ex-husband and daughter walking up behind her. I quickly snapped two or three pictures. I knew they weren't getting along well with the separation and upcoming divorce. It was her idea not his and he was not happy about it. I thought he would appreciate these pictures with all three of them in the picture. After I finished I caught up with him. They were on their way to the dream ball. We were going through these different areas of the hotel and up these steps. I caught up with him. I said, Mike. Mike. Wait. I was just taking some pictures of your wife and she doesn't realize it but I got some pictures with you and your daughter in them too. We were going up some steps as I said this and I was a couple of steps behind him. He turned half way around and said, If you're not careful you're going to be ticking Mike off too.

617,"I was at the SAID conference. There was going to be a parade. I was headed to the place where I was going to help create a float. I was wondering where everyone else, where all the other groups or organizations were creating their floats. The people who were showing up later to work on our float didn't even know what the people who started it intended for it to be. Then we were having a race in a swimming pool. We weren't swimming. We were in small rafts about the size of an inner tube because our legs hung over the edge. There was a brass bar all around the inside edge of the pool. When they told us to go I used that bar to help propel me around the pool and stay in the front of everyone. I came in third in my group - they had divided everyone into groups and then the winner from each group was to do the final race. Well, I thought I came in third but when I got out and went to stand in third place they told me I came in fifth. I still knew that I was going to have to compete again because they were going to take the top five of each group to race again. But they didn't. We now have our clothes on and are dressed up. Like most of the other women I had on heels. They told us to line up along the edge of the pool, facing the water. There were too many of us - we extended beyond the end of the pool. So they told some of us to stand on the ledge right inside the edge of the pool. I was one that had to do that. I was very nervous about doing this because of my heels and because the ledge wasn't as wide as my feet were long. I was afraid I was going to fall in so I had my feet angled a bit. I was thinking about the shoes that I was wearing. It seems that I always wear the same pair. I have another pair at home that would have gone very well with my clothes. I thought I should have worn those. I know that Samuel K was there. He was saying something about how to do this more successfully.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-20),-0.13362274,0.075843506
618,"Lee and the FD. My family owned the FD, the place that I worked when I was in high school. I had just arrived. Everyone else was there already and had started eating dinner. I think Aunt P and Aunt H were there as well. I went back to the kitchen to fix myself something. One of the freezer's was standing partially open, there was too much food in it and the door wouldn't close all the way. Some of the others were eating fried chicken that looked good so I decided to fix that for myself. There were two deep fryers, one above the other. The top one was used only for French Fries and there were French Fries in the basket and some just floating in the fryer. I noticed that because the only time fries should have been in the basket is if they were frying, and there shouldn't have been any floating loose in the fryer. The pieces of chicken were very small so I put two in the bottom fryer - one leg and one other piece. There wasn't very much oil in there so I couldn't completely submerse the chicken. I hoped they would cook completely anyway. I put the rest of the bag of chicken back in the freezer. When I did I realized that the only reason the door wouldn't close all the way earlier is because of the way some one had put this bag in there. It closed fine now. I saw that my chicken was cooking very slowly so I looked at the temperature controls and noticed that they were both turned way down. I tried to turn my up but wasn't being successful. I stuck my head out into the dining room and asked someone if they knew what I was doing wrong. Lee, my boyfriend only, came back to help. He looked like the young actor I've seen on TV on the show Crossing Jordan. The one interested in Jordan. He said he knew how to adjust it. There were two dials that you need to adjust. He took care of it for me, gave me a light kiss on the lips as he put his hand on my arm and then went back into the dining room. I don't know where we are but we have luggage with us. We were going somewhere but I don't know where. I know that my older brother and Lee were both with me. I think we are at an airport. When we arrived there Lee was going to go talk to someone or do something. He wanted to check with me first and make sure I didn't mind and that I would be okay. I said, sure. We kissed a couple of times, briefly. Again, as he put his hands on my arms. He told me I was the best. I was thinking that it was nice to be in a relationship with such complete mutual trust and affection. I was thinking how fortunate I was. Bob F and I were sitting at a table. I had some of my coins lying on the table in front of us. When I picked them up to put them in my wallet I realized that there were these other things there as well that looked kind of like coins, maybe more like mashed bottle caps but they were very shiny and gold and silver just like coins. They each said something on them though, in larger print than you would see on a coin. I started sorting them out from my coins to put them back on the table. Bob F said something about Bill F. I said, Yes. Bill F probably would like these. I was thinking about the fact that while I only pick up and save coins that I find on the street, Bill F picks up and saves anything even remotely looking like a coin - game tokens, etc. So I decided to keep these things and give them to Bill F. Bob F and I had taken our things and we were in a very large elevator, kind of like a freight elevator. There were other people in there as well. I noticed something about these people but now I can't recall what. They were doing something to delay us or something and I was trying not to be irritated or annoyed by it.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-21),-0.08000085,0.08796721
619,"The old music group The Monkees wanted to make a comeback. Someone was trying unsuccessfully to help them. I made some suggestions that fell on deaf ears. The band members had mixed emotions about the comeback. Micky Dolenz was the one that wanted it most. Peter Tork and Mike Nesmith were easily able to let it go. I don't remember hearing Davey Jones' feelings about it. Mickey wanted the comeback very badly and was very upset that it wasn't working out. I got a call from an agent or some such person in California. She wanted to come meet with them. Someone had suggested that she meet Mickey in BR near the train station. I called her and asked if she would be staying in town and she said that she would be returning to CA on the same day. I then suggested that they just meet at the airport. It would be easier for everyone and save her time. She said that was a good idea. She gave me her flight information, airline and flight number, and told me to have him meet her at baggage claim. After I finished speaking with her I realized that I did not get her flight number nor did I make arrangements for how they would find each other. Then I realized that she might know what Mickey looks like from past TV programs and albums. I called Mickey and shared the good news. I told him he could get online and look up her flight to see what time it arrives. Since she is leaving the same day I thought it was odd that she would want to meet at baggage claim. I have the sense that she was going to have baggage with her but I don't know why she would. I was at the airport and met her. I was sitting and chatting with her and employees from the airline came up and spoke with her. They obviously knew each other. I summized that she used to work for the airline. We went to sit in a different place in the airport, at a small round table. A gentleman came up to bring us something and he knew this woman also. They were old friends. He was tall, average build, brown hair but balding, and wore glasses. He had on a white shirt. He worked there, maybe at a restaurant at the airport. As we sat there we were watching this large crowd of people, mostly women, yelling and screaming. It turns out they were watching the Monkees perform. I said to this woman, see how much they love them? She nodded her head yes. I don't know if this was happening live or on TV. The woman's male friend came up to the table again and as he began to walk away she said, Oh. I'm sorry. Let me introduce you to my dear friend Mark. [unknown if this is someone I know in waking life.] He turned back around and shook my hand. I noticed he was wearing a wedding ring but had the impression that he was single. I don't know what gave me that impression. I was thinking what a nice man he was. A little later the woman and I were sitting and talking with him. He had something written across his forehead. It was probably five or six lines of text, very clearly readable, and an arrow with a red stem and blue tip. There was also a birthmark that looked a bit like an x. At first I thought the text and arrow were there for medical reasons and I felt sad for him that he had to live with that and how that must get people's attention and cause them to stare and such. It was impossible not to notice if you look at him but I tried not to look at it long enough to read what it said. I finally gave in though and read it. When I read it, it seemed to be there for fun, saying something about beer and I don't know what else. Then I thought it was just odd.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-07-25),-0.100540124,0.10071517

627,"I'm not sure if I'm watching this happen or if I'm there. This family is getting ready to get some landscaping work done in their yard. It's a fairly young couple with at least one child, a boy about 8-12 years old. The man is concerned that the landscaping will prevent him from practicing his putting in their yard. He's sitting across the street. The house sits on a corner where the left side of the house is along one street and the front of the house is, of course, along the other street, The man is sitting across the street from the left side of the house at a neighbor's. I don't know if I drew a diagram or if someone else drew it. The wife saw that he would have a place to put and that there would actually be a hole included in the landscape. Actually, there were two different features and they were called different things but they both basically functioned the same, as the putting hole. I can't remember now what the other one was called. I was standing there with a garden hose, spraying the lawn. As I was doing that you could see in the water spray something about these two putting holes. The wife was saying something about how that would look. Then they also had a swimming pool and I think maybe we were filling the pool or adding water to the pool. I went around to the left side of the house to check on the pool. It was pretty full so the 12-year-old was following me around so I asked him if he wanted to run around front and shut the water off so he did. I think he wanted to help so I was looking for ways for him to help. The man was a firefighter and I think the neighbor was also. He had come back across the street to the front yard. There were old fire engines. They looked like antique fire engines. There were two of them. One was parked in the front yard and one in the left side yard. I don't know if they were actually sitting in the yard. They were yellow. Even though they looked like antiques the firefighters still use them. On the one that was sitting in the left yard I started it up and then shut it off. Then I went around to the front of the house. The man had heard me and the engine was still gurgling. I thought there was a problem with the transmission or something that it was still shutting off. A little bit later it was still going - I could still hear it. I was hoping that the man couldn't but he did. He said something to me about not shutting it off fully. I said I did but then when I went to check I realized that he was right. I hadn't shut it off all the way. I went ahead and shut it off the rest of the way. I was thinking about the fact that I hadn't shut it off completely the first time and how he would tell me that I needed to be more careful. I didn't think it was a matter of being careful. The more I thought about it the more I realized that it was a matter of taking the time to make sure it was done right. I could just hear him saying, Well. We're firefighters. We have to do things in a hurry. But even then we know that we also have to take the time to do it right. I could just hear myself getting this speech from him and I was preparing to defend myself. Then I was trying to think of a form of the word cautious and couldn't think of the form of the word that I wanted. I still can't.

He was going to be staying there at the house and doing a class there. It turned out that there was only a handful of people there for it. I got the sense that I was living there as well. I think maybe it morphs from the CAS office to a home and then at one point to a doctor's office. At one point a couple shows up. They may be in their 40's or 50's. The man has a health concern and he came to get a prescription. The doctor wasn't there. I got out a prescription pad and took down the information, filled out the prescription except for the signature. I told him that as soon as I got the doctor to sign it I would call them and let them know that it was ready to pick up. The woman was saying something about how nice the house was. I said, Yes, except for the business next door with their PA system. While I'm talking to them I also have a little girl with me. It's Bev but in the dream she is only 18-24 months old. I'm carrying her around and I'm worried about how well she will behave. But I'm trying to take care of these other people, the couple and Caleb S and his dream students.

I decide that I just need to take her in the bathroom with me. Then I think that maybe I'm just going to need to give her a bath at the same time, though I really don't want to do that. I'm debating if it is okay. Then someone says something about Bev needing to use the potty. I guess we're trying to potty train her. I say something about just giving her a book and she can sit on the potty in the bathroom while I'm taking a shower. Then I go do something else first. When I came back I asked if they gave her a book and they said she was just going to stay out there. Now Bev is her current age in waking life. Maybe the little girl is now Rachel S. I'm not sure.

633,"I was at a hotel. There was some kind of major event going on. It was almost like a street fair and maybe a parade. I'm not sure. There were vendors in the street that were selling all kinds of things, even clothing. There were racks of women lingerie and all of these different women were taking things and trying them on and then coming back out and looking through the racks more while they were still wearing the lingerie. I wondered where they were going to try these things on. There were a lot of people. I was working my way through the crowd. It seems as though it may have been along a beach as well because at one point I was out walking on the beach. I saw some people trying to find some seashells. I thought I should ask someone, someone that I know but I don't remember now who, if I come out early enough if I would find some seashells. I did find two or three, but I think they were actually just clamshells. They were black and the inside looked like a normal clamshell, shiny, pearlized. But they were very dark. I was with a female friend but I don't know who she was. She had her two little boys with her. We had these things to help children not get separated from their parents, but the parents held on to these things. It was a little round thing about the size of a quarter in diameter and maybe a couple of inches long. The bottom side of it the child pushed in and it locked into place so they wouldn't get separated from their parents. But it depended on the child to keep pushing in on this thing. That seems ridiculous. One of the two boys was playing around with it so I crouched down to their level and looked at the two of them and said, Look. Look at my face. I'm not kidding around. Do you see me smiling or laughing? They were still kind of grinning. I said, Look how serious I am. They finally quit smiling. I said, You have GOT to keep these things pushed in. You HAVE to. Do you understand me? It is SO important that you keep these things pushed in. I don't know if they really understood or not. Then this friend and I decided to take them outside. Now they are little girls instead of boys. Now I think we are going trick or treating. But up until this point it wasn't that time of year and it wasn't the time of day that you would go trick or treating. It was a summer day. On our way outside the mom got detoured and had to stop for a minute. When we got outside it was pouring down rain. The girls didn't like that. I wondered where my umbrella was and was thinking that I should have brought it along. One of us could have carried the umbrella while the other hung on to the girls. We started out a little bit anyway. The one little girl was especially frantic about the rain so I finally said, Okay. Let's go back in. I thought we could at least stand under the overhang until the mom came out. The one little girl let go of her thing and took off running. I was yelling at her to come back but with the rain and everything she couldn't hear me. I was yelling frantically and as loud as I could. Either she couldn't hear me or she ignored me because she just kept running. I was panicking because I thought I would never find her in this business and her mother is going to be so angry with me. Fortunately, her mom came out and met the little girl head on. The mom looked at me and just glared at me so upset. I was standing there feeling helpless. I didn't know what I could have done since I was still holding on to the other little girl. I had told them how important it was that they not let go. When the one took off running I was yelling as loud as I could trying to get her to come back. I couldn't take off running because the one I was still holding on to couldn't have run fast enough and I couldn't have run very fast if I had tried to carry her. It was just a very bad situation. I am back inside without the three of them. There was something going on in the one part of this building. I say hotel but I'm not totally sure it was a hotel. In one part of this building there was a company that was getting ready to do a fashion show. There was some kind of problem that was delaying it. For some reason I needed to get to the end of this building. There was some kind of problem that would keep me from getting there the normal way. I decided to try to take a different way to get to the other end of this building. But as I did there was a high school band getting ready for the parade I guess. I realized I shouldn't be cutting through there but I did it anyway. I was trying to work my way through all of these young people in their band uniforms. I would go through one room and there would be another band. I would try to work my way through that room. Every now and then when I entered another room one of the chaperones or teachers would be there. Fortunately there was so much noise and commotion that when they tried to stop me or ask me what I wanted I just kept going and managed to get past them.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-08-10),-0.10656012,0.059206158

637,"I completed my dissertation proposal and had sent it to Deven D. A day or two later he was at my home. This was my house on Lakeland Dr. where I lived with my husband. I wasn't all that surprised to see him there. I asked him if he had been home yet since conference. I think he said he had been home for one day. He had a briefcase sitting at the entrance to the family room. It was sitting open and I saw the envelope for my dissertation proposal in there. At first I was just glad to see it because I hoped that I could talk to him about it now. But then I also thought it curious that he had received it so quickly. There were also things in his briefcase besides papers and the types of things that you would expect to see in a briefcase but I can't remember what they were. There were two other people, women, there. I think they may have been from CIIS. One of them might have been Terri O. We were talking about my proposal. The woman I don't know asked me about my timeline for completion. I said I intend to complete it by Spring 2005. She nodded her head yes. I said that my ideal, however, was to complete it by the end of 2004, though I admitted that I didn't know if that would be possible. She shook her head no, as if to say to me that there is no way I would be able to achieve that goal.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-08-14),-0.056618292,0.02857338
641,Jan F was at my house. We were talking about cooking. She and Jo V love to cook and I don't. She was talking about taking various frozen meals that come in a bag and mixing them together and fixing them at one time and then having meals that can be heated quickly and having a number of them. I said I didn't think I would want to do that because I would get tired of eating the same thing over and over. I said that I do occasionally fix one of those for myself and have leftovers for a day or two after. She suggested mixing a half of each one for a different variety. I said that might not be a bad idea because then you would get three varieties instead of two or instead of just one. I was cleaning up the kitchen while we were talking. I put an empty can inside of what I thought was an empty pineapple can. But when I did I realized that there was still a layer of pineapple in the can. I pulled the other can back out and said something to Jan F. I asked her if she did that on my behalf and she laughed and said yes. I don't know why. I took the pineapple out of the can and then I was asking here when school was going to be out for the summer and if she would be spending a lot of time in Chicago during summer break.

655,"I was working at the CAS office. There seems to be scene changes. It's kind of weird. There was a part about being at a sleep center and going to have a sleep study. They were trying to there was a girl that was fairly new. She was fitting people for apnea machine masks. Jane C came in. I thought she was having a sleep study too. It is almost as though this sleep center is physically connected to the CAS office. I find out after whatever I did that Jane C had a sex change operation. I'm just completely flabbergasted that she would do this - especially because I knew she hadn't told Bill C yet. I just thought that was very, very wrong. I thought he had the right to know before she decided to do this. I went and found Doctor C and asked him if I could speak to him in private immediately. I told him it was urgent. So we went into a room or his office and I closed the door. I told him what happened. I said, Doesn't he have a right to know this? He's her husband. I think he said that she should have told him but that as care providers they could not breech that confidentiality. I have a folder, or someone had a folder with some pictures. They looked like pictures and articles out of magazines. One of the pictures is of Jane C. One of them looks like a picture of her as a child with another child. I don't know who the other child is. One of them looks like her as a man. I'm talking to someone about this, saying how angry I am, that he had a right to know this before she did it. She should have told him before she did it. I cannot be the one to tell him for any number of reasons. I was also very afraid that he would find out that I knew before he did. I said something to the affect that he thought that she was having some kind of surgery to make her vaginal opening smaller. Then there is something where we are it almost looks like we're in maybe we're still in the CAS office. It looks like we're in a two-story home. There are other women there. We all know each other. We all know Bill C and Jane C. Someone gave me this can of stuff. It reminds me of the toy that you buy that sprays out silly string. But every time I spray it, it just kind of makes a mess on the wall, even though I think I've shaken it well. Some man, of the men there, a friend of ours or something, comes along behind me and kind of wipes it off the wall. One place along the stairwell I notice that the wall has potting soil splattered all over it. In the dream I knew how it got there but now I don't remember. I kept thinking that we needed to get it cleaned up soon before our guests arrive. Somebody ended up showing Bill C this folder or telling him about Jane C or he ends up finding the folder and then someone tells him that Jane C had this operation. He just rushes out to be by himself. I go looking for him because I'm concerned about him. I want to see if he wants someone to talk to. Someone, maybe it's Jane C, tells me that I need to just leave him be for awhile. I said I didn't want to do that because I'm concerned about him. I said sometimes it helps to have someone to talk to. I heard someone say that sometimes it doesn't that sometimes you just need to leave them have their time to themselves. Somewhere along here I hear Jane C say that this is something that she has needed to do her entire life. And she doesn't really feel any remorse regarding Bill C because she's just so glad to finally have had this done. Then there is a scene where Bill C is actually confronting her and saying something about their marriage vows not meaning anything, their marriage not meaning anything all these years, etc. One of them walks away, I don't know which one. I go looking for Bill C again. Somewhere along here I admit to an occasional attraction to Bill C when working with him. I said that seems perfectly natural since we have the intellectual connection that we do. That has always been for me the biggest attraction to a man for me - when I have a strong intellectual connection.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-08-30),-0.18180083,0.010951524

I'm not sure if she was only referring to the found money or not. I was amazed at how frequently I kept finding coins in this area. Sometimes the deck was wet. I also found a stack of very large coins and casino chips. I found the man that they belonged to and tried to return them to him. He only wanted one of them back, in the amount of $50.

669,"I'm at a restaurant. Matthew was working there. I know they serve pizza. I was back in the kitchen area talking to Matthew. The owner was back there also. I watched him cut a pizza to take out to a customer. I'm having a conversation with Matthew about something that he sold at school like he was selling it for a fund-raiser. He had taken orders. I think it was food items. He had taken orders but now he was having trouble collecting from people. I was concerned that he was going to have to come up with the money himself and then be stuck with this food. He showed me the money that he had collected and gave me the list of what he had sold and who he needed to collect from. We were checking off what he had gotten paid for. There was some confusion. He showed me a check for $56 and told me who it was from so I checked it off. Then later he said, Oh no. That wasn't from them. It was from someone else. I corrected my notes. As we were talking, because I was concerned that he was just going to have to come up with the money. He said, No. I don't have to. If they don't come through the company just takes the stuff back. But the man that was supplying this food was really upset because he wasn't being successful at collecting this money and he was really unhappy about having to take this stuff back. I could tell the owner of the pizza place was getting aggravated with us for trying to resolve this then. Someone brought another pizza out of the oven, so I cut it myself so it could be taken out. Matthew said he was just going to leave work, that he needed to go take care of this. I told him he wasn't. He said there was nothing else that he could do. I told him that there was. I told him that he was hired to do a job, to be here when he needs you to be here, to help him run his business and that's exactly what you will do. Well have to take care of this another time. I think Allison P was working there also. I think her and I were talking for a little while. I don't know where Matthew went or what the owner was doing. But Matthew and I were talking a little bit.

693,"I was at a hotel with Bill C. We were giving a presentation. When he first started the program there were only three or four people there. We had the tables set up in the U shape that we typically do. I was sitting at one of the tables. There was a gentleman sitting next to me. He reminds me of the man who usually sat behind me at photography class. About one half hour into the program I noticed some people standing outside the door so I went out and told them to go on in and have a seat. Tons of people started coming. I started asking them if they had trouble finding us or if they misunderstood what time the program started. I'm pointing out empty seats to people. I filled all the seats and there were still more people. Some were just going in and getting some chairs from a different place in the room. It was a very large meeting room and we were just at one end where we had set up our tables. The rest of the room was set up as the people who had arrived on time had been served a meal before the program. The facility had not cleaned it up yet. Some people were just grabbing chairs from there and dragging them over to where we were and just sitting outside of the U, not at the tables. I went over and started clearing off one of the table, putting the stuff onto another table. Someone of them were six foot tables and some were very small square tables with a single leg in the middle. I started to sit something on one of the small square tables but decided it might get out of balance and this stuff fall off. Some of the things were bowls about the size of punch bowls and they had ice water in them all the way to the edge. I tried to sit two of those on one of the small square tables, at opposing corners to balance them but I was still afraid they would spill so I moved them to another table. Then on this same table someone had left part of a sandwich from a fast food place. I was trying to clean it up without actually touching the food. I finally cleaned off one of these tables and turned it so it was parallel to one of ours and put a couple of chairs there for more people. I went into another room that had computers in it. I was going to try to quickly type up a form with three columns of blank lines. At the top of one I was going to put Name. At the top of the next I was going to put Email. At the top of the other I was going to put Fax. I knew Bill C would want that, to have people write down their information before they left. I was going to make this form and then stand outside the door with this form on a clipboard so people could sign it as they left. When I went into this other room with the computers, someone had been messing with my computer. I couldn't figure out how to reset to the way I had it set up so I could find my word documents. There was a woman in that room working at a computer. Her computer was fine so she was going to do it for me. But as she started our program ended and even though I told her there was no need to do it now she kept working on it. I think she might have actually been filling in these people's names and emails and fax numbers but I don't know how she would know this information. Later I went to find Bill C and I saw him sitting in the back of this empty room in an upholstered armchair. He was looking very ashen - not physically well. I expressed my concern. He said something about not being able to discuss personal things with me - at my lead. There was also something about small, black discs that looked like tiny LP's. And there was something about kisses. ",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-10-24),-0.27268067,0.08909138
695,"I had gone into the office. I was kind of dressed up, in a skirt and jacket kind of suit and high-heeled shoes. The office building had a much larger lobby and maybe something like a kiosk or two set up in the lobby. It seemed to be for business people, at the least the first time I walked by them. I had gone into the lobby a second time and stopped and sat down at one of these Kiosk's. I opened a package that we had received in the mail. It had a set of pens and automatic pencils in it that had the CAS name and logo on it. It was from a company that was trying to get us to purchase these. It wasn't a bad set but they were purple and that certainly isn't a color Bill C would purchase. The pens and pencils themselves looked nice enough. Not very impressive. Bill C came out and had one in his hand. The package that he hadn't opened. He said something to me about it and I told him what it was. We were back in the office and there was another employee there named Sally [unknown in waking life] . I walked by Bill C's office and Bill C and Sally were standing there in a kind of casual embrace. He was leaning against the wall. She had her arms around his waist and he had his around her shoulders. Obviously she was shorted than he, as most people are in waking life. They kissed lightly a couple of times. This bothered me a lot. I was thinking about why it bothered me so much. I didn't know if it was because he is a married man, or if I was envious for some reason. I didn't sense that it was a romantic thing between them or a romantic envy on my part. They had become good friends and appreciative of each other through working together and that's all it was. My feelings might have been an envy of that type of relationship - or that he would demonstrate that with her in such a way, even though he may feel the same towards me. I got so upset though that I finally decided to leave for a little while. I went home and changed clothes. Or was about to change into slacks and a more casual top and more casual shoes. When I got ready to leave and go back to the office I found two things in my mailbox. They were things that I had sent out from work but they were returned to me at my home and they were open. I don't remember why they were returned to me. I struggled getting them out of the mailbox and took them into the house. I was looking at why they had been returned. I left and went out to what I thought was my car. I hadn't parked where I normally do. I had parked down further to the left and to the other side. When I got over there I realized it wasn't my car at all and I was looking and couldn't find it. I finally realized that I had parked a couple of streets over. I was in a hurry because I wanted to get back to the office before 4:30, hoping Bill C would still be there when I got there. I thought, Omigosh. If I still have to walk all the way over there to my car I may not make it. My home was different than in waking life. I was looking at this grassy area, kind of like a common area behind my house. I thought that maybe if I cut directly through there I could get to my car quicker. I tried to do that but there were lots of families, especially children, back there playing. It occurred to me that it was Saturday and that Bill C may not be there when I get back anyway. I was still going to try. It occurred to me how unusual it was that I would be dressed up the way I was or even am now to go into the office on a Saturday. I was trying to make my way across this common area, through all of these people. I had to stop a couple of times. I heard someone say, Excuse me ma'am. There was a football headed towards me and they didn't want me to get hit. I went a little further and then there were two moms, one was pitching and the other batting, and the kids were playing the field. They were all within a few feet of each other though. I had to wait. I couldn't get around them. I had to go in between the pitcher and the batter so I had to wait for a break. As soon as there was I ran through. Then I came to a place where there a lot of chain link fences like you would typically see around a sports field. I had to climb up and over fence after fence after fence.

702,Matthew had gotten a dog for Ashley B. It looked just like Belle. Not full grown but maybe just a few months old. Not a puppy either. Ashley B had just had a baby. We were at home but our home looked different than in it does in waking life. He and a friend left and without asking me just left the dog there with me. There were also seeking permission from the city or something to cut a tree down outside the house for some reason because of the dog. I was upset because I didn't want the tree cut down. But also because they didn't ask me about any of this before he did it. At some point Darren H and Annie H showed up but I'm not sure why.

708,"I was in my home study and doing some cleaning or organizing. It didn't look like my study in waking life. It was much larger and had maybe eight filing cabinets, some two drawer and some four. Some were wider than they were deep. I was thinking about ways that I could rearrange all of these cabinets so I would have more space. The way some of them were sitting now it created a big empty space behind them - they were sitting in an L shape. As I was doing this I kept finding drawers full of office supplies. On some of the two drawer filing cabinets I had plastic file boxes with two or three drawers each, sitting on top. You could see into those as they were clear on the front and side with colored tops and frames. These also had tons of office supplies in them. Matthew came in and I was showing him all of these office supplies that I had. Apparently I had accumulated them because every time I needed something I went out and bought it, buying a few extra to have on hand, and forgetting that I already had some on hand in the study. I told Matthew I thought I was going to box them all up and give them away to an organization in the fall - an organization that collects school supplies for needy children. He thought too this was a good idea. Mother and Daddy came to visit. My home was at the top of a steep hill. It was winter and there was snow and ice on the street and driveway. They were in a van and I saw them come up the hill and then go back down and park at the bottom of the hill. Daddy had a difficult time finding a place that he could safely walk up the hill. I wondered why they didn't park at the top of the hill near my door, but then realized that there were no guest parking spaces there. I did then realize, however, that there were two handicap spaces but they had too much snow piled in them to be able to park there. I went to the office, which in this case almost seemed to be an outdoor office and the woman working there was behind a large glass partition. There was a small window hole in the glass to speak to her through. I asked her if she could have the handicap spaces cleared in the future. A little later I realized she had someone come and clear them right away. I suggested that Mother and Daddy go ahead and move their van into one of the spaces right away. Daddy wanted to walk down the hill so I went with him. Walking down was more dangerous because of the ice and snow. I identified a place along the hill that was shaped somewhat like steps. It had snow on it but it was safer than the icy walkway. So he stepped onto that and began making his way down. We got to a point where he had to step back down onto the walkway. It was a pretty tall step down however. I held out my left hand to help him balance and keep him from falling as he stepped down. I realized this was the hand that had been hurting so much and couldn't support any weight but I went ahead and used it anyway. Back in the house I found a few drawers that had Halloween costumes in them. One had several rubber masks in it. I pulled one out that was purple and lime green. I showed it to Daddy and told him that it matched what he was wearing that day. He had on a one piece something that was purple and lime green. It looked like it could be worn as a Halloween costume though that was not it's intended use. Daddy tried the mask on. I was watching him trying on, I don't know that anyone else was paying attention. It was a tight fit and I was becoming concerned that he was going to suffocate. He was having trouble finding the front of the mask where he could breath through this mouth and nose and see. I realized that the mask had faces on both the front and back. I reached down with my right hand, I think Daddy was sitting at this point, and tried to move it around to help him find the face holes. I got them in the right position but then realized there was a liner on the inside that was out of place and blocking all of the holes. I finally, and gently, slid the mask off of his head. I told him I didn't think it was a good idea for him to borrow that one. He agreed that he did not want to borrow that one but we did find another that he could borrow. I checked with Matthew to be sure he wasn't planning to use any of them between now and the next Halloween, because Halloween had just passed. He said he wouldn't.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-15),-0.21764416,0.21067403

716,"I was putting up my outdoor Christmas decorations. The outside of my house looked different than in waking life. As I was starting I either thought or said that I knew exactly how I wanted to do it. Once I got started I said I didn't know how I wanted it. I think I had an extension cord out but no lights. I was trying to figure out where to put the Nativity scene. I didn't want the lights from it to bother any of the neighbors. I was also trying to decide if I wanted it in the front yard where my neighbors might enjoy it most or if I wanted to put it on my patio where I would enjoy it most. It seems that I had left some of the figures standing all year because I pulled them out of the ground. As I was doing that I noticed there were small, white, porcelain angel figurines that had gotten buried in the dirt. There were two or three of them.

It had double garage doors, on the left side of the L. You had to pull across the front of the house to pull into the garage. Very odd. I was inside the new part of the house with Brian F, I think. It was framed. I think they were starting to work on the kitchen. I was talking about when they were going to move in. It seems that the new house was on the same property as the current house so they were going to move in one room at a time. As one room was finished they were going to move in to it. So they were moving into the kitchen first. They were using some of the kitchen cabinets from the current house in the new house. Brian F was talking about being excited about moving in. I made the comment that I had no intention of moving in this new house. He was put off by this and didn't understand. I'm not sure why I was so adamant about not moving in this new house.",elizabeth.tsv,(2003-11-18),-0.1927102,0.0006898264

720,I was at BJ's house for some kind of family event. Mike A was going to be attending. She was concerned that she didn't have enough ice. Brian F said he would run to the nearest store and buy some. She said that wouldn't do because Mike doesn't like that kind of ice. Then Brian F suggested we put her ice in a separate bowl for Mike A to use and the rest of us could use the bought ice. She still wasn't sure. I told her that I agree with Brian F. I went with him to buy the ice. There was something else that we had to do while we were getting the ice. It had something to do with a dog named Appleby. I think John S and someone else went with us also. Maybe Bev. We went to this place. It's like Brian F had rented this dog and we were returning it. We were walking down an aisle trying to find Appleby's spot so to speak. They were wooden shelves that had wooden partitions. On the back wall behind the shelf they had their names painted in very decorative lettering with pictures and such. We finally found Appleby's. Brian F laid a credit card there to pay for whatever it was. I thought that was very odd that he was comfortable just laying his credit card there and leaving it. I don't know how or when he was going to get it back. I got out my wallet to see if I had enough cash. It was $16 and I had exactly that. I gave it to Brian F so he could leave that instead of his credit card. Now I'm there alone at the front desk. I was talking to someone. She needed $8.80 plus tax. I only had $8.80 so I called BJ's house to see if someone could come with the rest of the cash that I needed for whatever it was I was doing for them. BJ and Jody S showed up with the rest of the cash. The receipt had fallen on the ground. It had manure on it. No one wanted to pick it up so we were kicking the manure so we could read the receipt. The woman who worked there finally took a couple of swipes at it to knock it into a position where we could finally read it. I told BJ and Jody S that someone was going to need to come back in a couple of days but I don't know why. I don't know what it was we were paying for. We went back to the house. Mike A showed up. I was outside with BJ when he showed up. The three of us went inside. I was observing him. I couldn't believe how different he seemed. BJ thought it was just an act. I wasn't sure.

I told her I would make the copy and get it to her. I also told them both that if they had changed their mind or do change their mind about being on my committee because of time I certainly would understand. But it seems that maybe each of them were working on their PhD as well. We were talking about all of the technical editing. I said to them that I didn't think they should make themselves crazy about the technical editing of the proposal since we were required to hire a technical editor anyway at $25 an hour.

I was concerned about the inherent dangers of growing a company too fast - hiring so many people at once. It seems that there was one woman in charge of all the others but I don't know who it was. They were all eating lunch, at their desks. there was a TV in the lobby and a silver cart with two shelves on wheels. I suggested they put the TV on the cart and move it into the break room so they could have lunch there and watch TV while they eat. I was hoping this would encourage all of them to eat in the break room rather than at their desks. I realized that they may have taken their cue to eat at their desk from me since I always have lunch at my desk. For several reasons I did not feel it was appropriate for them to eat their lunch at their desks - they don't work while they eat, they are hourly workers, we enforce breaks with them, etc. Later I was watering the plants, which I don't do in waking life, and saw that Bill C had put small water fountains in the middle of two of the plants in the lobby. I thought this was very odd and didn't particularly care for it but decided not to say anything as it wasn't that big of a deal.

There was some confusion about what we were putting in it. There was confusion about how many entries on one. One was a list of names and addresses. The first time we did it, it didn't go in right - like in the correct column. The next time it was either the wrong list or the wrong information. We got all that figured out but saw there were too many entries and needed to cut it back. I think we were going to do a mailing. The person who owned the data was fretting because he didn't think we could cut it back as much as the other person was saying that we needed to. We were going to.

We were talking about this as we were packing and getting ready to leave. We had each only packed one very small suitcase because it was such a short conference. As we were packing we had the door open. Dalton G stopped by the room and said something. I said I was sorry that we hadn't had a chance to chat this time but next time hopefully we would. I continued packing, pulling things out of the closet onto the bed. I kept finding more and more things that belonged to me on the shelf of the closet. Large and unusual items that one would not normally pack for such a trip. The one item was a rather large, empty flowerpot that was stained from prior use. I was beginning to wonder how I had managed to get all of this stuff into this small suitcase. I had put some things inside other things. I also realized that, as usual, I was going home with more things than I had come with. I did have a nylon satchel of sorts that I could use to take extra things home. It didn't have a shoulder strap though. As I was emptying the closet I found a shoulder strap from a previous hotel guest and decided to take it and use it on my bag. There was still a lot of stuff left in the closet that didn't belong to Macy F or me. There was a row of books, CD's, or DVD's. I'm not sure which. Now I am in a car with BJ and Kim H. Kim H is talking about sorting through this row of books or whatever. She is criticizing BJ for not doing it each time she is there. So Kim H said that she did it.

However, there were places that there was supposed to be a graphic and there was not. It was the job of the group to select a graphic for those empty spaces and put one in. We had a number of different options for selecting graphics. I suggested to the group that we choose one of those options and stay with it, as it would help us to be more effective.

Afterwards the person who had hired me said she would like to go ahead and get the pens for everyone - I had apparently quoted her to include them but she opted out. I reminded her that she had opted out and as such not paid for them, so the additional fee would be around $1,000. They were about $1 each, personalized, and she needed 1,000. She didn't answer me but I had the sense that she needed to think about it or that she really didn't want to buy them, having been reminded of the price. One of the attendees came up to me afterwards and asked me how I learned to draw. She asked me if I see what I am drawing or if I just see lines. I pointed to an individual as an example and said, I look at her face. I simply look at the lines of her face, such as the lines of her nose, her hair, etc. She asked me if I could recommend some books that would help her get started. I was hesitant to tell her about the books that I used because I had bought them used at the Half Price Books store. I thought I might tell her that my books are very old and were given to me by someone. In my head I was justifying the lie by telling myself they were a gift - from me to me.

The living spaces we were working on must have been fairly unusual. I don't remember what the houses looked like only the spaces we were working with. We had designed cubes that were completely open on one side. They were just slightly smaller than the size of the room we were working on. These cubes could be lifted with a fork-lift and slid into the room. Rather than accessing through a door the owner would access through the open wall of this cube. It appears that there is no other part of the structure/home around the frame that we slide the cube into. All of the cubes we were doing seemed to be home office spaces. We had designed them all at one time. We designed several different looks based on certain needs. Then we identified which look was best for each person. At one point the content of the cubes was more like text on a page rather than a room layout. We decided that one person would need several cubes because it was simply way too much text for one page and that multiple cubes was not a good option - maybe not an option at all. I came up with the idea of putting the text onto computer files so the person would have easy access. I said this would actually work much better for them than simply laying it out in the cube anyway.

But that's what she said. I said, Oh. Well then you won't be able to open it because an old version of Publisher can't open a document that was created in a newer version unless both versions are 2002 or newer. Then John S was going to do some work on my computer. I had a new hard drive to install and something else but I don't what it was. It was something that I have never installed before. So he was working on my computer and he was working on some other stuff too. He got ready to quit and he hadn't installed this one thing that was most important yet. He said something about not getting it done so I started asking him if it was something I could install myself or asking him how to install it myself. Then I think Bev said something to him so he decided to go ahead and take the time to install it himself. I felt kind of bad about it but it turned out that it only took a few minutes to do.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-08),-0.14146033,0.23895594
810,"I was on a team working on a project. I have no idea who the team was or what the project was. I just know that we were working on these things that were made out of wood that were probably 5 or 6 feet square. Two perpendicular edges were trimmed with something that looks like crown molding. We were cutting the wood, cutting the molding and attaching it and then painting them. On the back of each one we were writing three things. I think they were paint color, style of crown molding and I can't remember what the other was. We thought we had them all done when we learned that we still needed a couple more. In another scene we were working on something else. There were six of those. They were much smaller but square. They did not have trim on them. They seem to be something decorative to be hung on walls. We had three of the six completed. It was very late in the day and we were all exhausted. We were asking someone, I think it was the designer, if she could make do with three because we were all just totally worn out and did not feel that we could even do one more.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-11),-0.14450982,0.13868214
812,I was in the apartment getting ready to do a load of laundry. But I was doing it in the toilet in the downstairs bathroom. I had a very large load of permanent press clothing. I thought I could do it all in one load. I realized there was no way I was going to get it all in there at once so I started pulling some pieces back out. When I thought I had enough things out I flushed the toilet and it started pulling one piece of clothing down and then it started overflowing. I was quickly pulling clothes out one piece at a time and dropping them onto the floor where the water was overflowing to soak up the water and keep it from spreading out further. In just seconds the water was like 3 or more inches deep but it wasn't leaving the bathroom into the kitchen. I think I finally did get enough of the clothes pulled out to either soak up the water or to block it so it wouldn't go out into the kitchen.,elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-13),-0.12222418,0.05160001
815,"I was living in an apartment building with a long hallway that had apartments along each side of the hallway. It almost looked like the hallway of a hotel. I had learned that one of my neighbors had a cleaning woman that was a, maybe even two of them, good and charged $83 per cleaning. Actually I think I talked to the neighbor first to see if she would tell me about her and tell me how much she charges. I was telling one of my other neighbors because I thought that was fairly reasonable. But then I think I said I knew someone else who charged less than that. Somehow though I was talking to a cleaning person, or thinking about talking to a cleaning person, to find out if there was a way that I could have her clean and it would be less money per cleaning or if I could afford to have her come just once a month.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-14),-0.27626833,0.13817832
825,I had ordered a new whirlpool bath. After I ordered it I was concerned that it would actually fit in my bathroom. What to do with the bathtub versus the shower stall. There was something like that going on.,elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-30),-0.055518467,0.20256506
826,"I was on my way to the CAS office to work. I needed to go to Kinko's on my way in to pick up some printing they had done for us. I was driving across 116th St. As I went through one of the intersections I saw the light turn red above me. Of course, I kept going because I was directly under the light when it turned red. As I got closer to R1 Rd., there were road crews working here and there. I think they were filling potholes. There would be two or three men at each of these different places and traffic was going pretty fast with this construction workers right there. They did not have it marked well so you would even notice them very far ahead. They weren't using orange cones or anything. Some of them were working along the side of the road to my right. Some of them were actually right in the middle of the two lanes. That was very dangerous and I was concerned for their safety, that some of them might get hurt. When I got close to where I would turn in to Kinko's there were construction workers right in the middle of the four lanes of traffic. There was also a big pile of sand right by the entrance to the parking lot. When I went to turn left into the parking lot I am now on foot. There was a lot of traffic so I ran to get across the two lanes. I think it also had been raining. I had on my white girl shoes so I was walking very gingerly so I wouldn't get my feet so wet and because I was walking through this sand. I noticed by this big pile of sand that there were also various shapes and sizes of rocks or stone. Maybe they used them to help fill potholes. I was stepping on them to avoid some of the water puddles. I was walking across the parking lot and I heard someone say something. I turned around to see if they were speaking to me and who it was. It was a woman with long blonde hair. I said, pardon me she repeated herself but I still didn't know what she said, I think I didn't understand her, but I might not have been able to hear her well. I just smiled and nodded yes, pretending that I had heard her. I kept walking. I got across the parking lot to the sidewalk where Kinko's should be but they weren't. That woman was still there so I asked her what happened to Kinko's. The space where they used to be was now a clothing store. She said something like, Well, do you just want to start here? I said, I'm sorry. I needed to go to Kinko's. What happened to them? They used to be right here. She said, Oh. No. She walked around the end of the building. At this point it almost looked as though there was a roof connecting the whole U-shaped shopping center.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-03-31),-0.06563428,0.0421833
827,"I was working in an unusual kind of Coffee Shop. The owner was a woman. The employees were both male and female. I was the newest person on the staff. We all wore costumes as part of the shop atmosphere. They were New Age or Gypsy-look. While we were working the owner said she needed to go check the Bubble Gum Bar. The Bubble Gum Bar was an area outside the building where she had a row of bubble gum machines. People could write a question they wanted advice on and insert it in the bubble gum machine. They would immediately get a piece of bubble gum and then after the owner had answered their question she would somehow get the answer back to them - she didn't do it right then and there so I'm not sure how they got their answers. The machines were set up like drive through bank machines. Inside the coffee shop the questions would come into the building in those same kind of tubes. I wanted her to let me begin answering the questions, or at least to do some of them. She was unsure about my ability to do so. One of the male employees was there and I was getting aggravated at him because he knew that I had already answered 12 of them prior to this and had my responses had been received very well by the coffee shop patrons. He wouldn't say anything to the owner, and I wouldn't either because I knew he was the one who should tell her - for whatever reason. I felt that I would be betraying him if I were to tell her myself. I kept looking at him trying to get him to speak up. Finally he did. She was surprised and then he showed her something that let her know how I did. I told her that because I work as a counselor and spiritual director outside the coffee shop I am well-qualified to work the bubble gum bar. She decided to let me try a few more. I think some of us are lying on mats on the floor talking. This man is kind of rolling around - being childlike and playful maybe? He rolls very close to me and our lips brush. I know he wants to kiss me but is hesitant to so he does this instead. I don't pursue it. Later I went to the Bubble Gum Bar counter inside to pick up the newest questions to answer them. Now there is a female employee who is upset because I get to answer the questions. I explain to her that I work as a counselor and spiritual director and because of that experience I am a good person to do it. The owner tries to make her feel better about this as well. After the owner walks away her and I continue to talk. She tries to convince me that I can trust her. I decide to at least let her read the questions. As we are reading through them I see her handing them to someone else to read. I become very upset that she betrayed my trust. I grab all of the questions and leave. People who drive up to the Bubble Gum Bar can see me at a window and can talk to me there. Justin Bateman drives up in a mini-van. He has several friends with him and two small boys, twins, who are his sons. They are about 4 or 5 years old. Justin is considering submitting a question but leery about doing so. I now tell him what I do for a living besides my work at the coffee bar. I want him to feel more comfortable submitting a question and feeling that he will get a meaningful, helpful response. For some reason all of the adults get out of the minivan and leave the twins in there. The van starts to roll away. I am now in the van but in the backseat and the boys are in the front seat. Justin is talking to them on a cell phone trying to tell one of them to put his foot on the brake, which one of them manages to do. In the meantime I crawled into the front seat, grabbed the steering wheel and got the van out of traffic, got my own foot on the brake, and then put the van into park. Justin shows up and is very grateful - feeling that I have saved his sons lives. I was very humble about it but glad to have been able to help. He now feels much better about submitting his question and having me answer it. There is also now some romantic interest - initiated by him. I'm thinking about it, primarily about the fact that he is so much younger than me but thinking that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. In waking life I have never dated anyone more than a year younger than myself. I had to get back inside the coffee bar. It was late at night and I was the only employee working. A large group of people came in for coffee. They were all together so they were laughing and having a great time. I was going from table to table to get their orders. All of our coffee drinks were unusual and had unusual names. The first table I went to had two women sitting together. They were having trouble deciding. A woman from another table called out to me what she wanted. I started to laughingly tell her that I would have to get what they wanted in order or I would never be able to keep it straight. While I was saying that, some members of the group told her to be nice to me and wait her turn. I was being very playful and goofy, making them laugh, and they were all having a great time. I went to get the orders from several of the members of their group that were on exercise mats on the floor. One of the men, my age or older, was doing yoga stretches. I began to mimic his moves. As I did a back bend I motioned to another that I needed help getting up. I didn't really but I did it playfully. It made them all laugh. The man who was stretching and the other man were saying something. I looked down kind of seductively and said, I can build it. And the man who wasn't stretching said, and he will come. I looked up and said, shame on you, knowing that he intended a sexual connotation. I had the same thought when I said it, but hoped they wouldn't know that, or maybe hoped it would occur to them but that they wouldn't be sure of my intention. I think I said it because I was interested in the man who was doing the stretches. It did seem to pique his interest in me.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-04-12),-0.29183808,0.043271977
830,"Myself and some of my family members were at a middle school, attending an event for Bob F's three older boys. They were all wearing navy blue slacks with red and gold shirts. I was thinking how grown up they all looked. Stephen F had said something to Bev about something he heard but he only told her part of it because he couldn't remember all of it. I was talking to Bev about it. Because he couldn't remember all of it, it seemed to cause her some concern about Rachel S. I remember saying to her Oh Bev, it's not like she's going to be the next Hitler.",elizabeth.tsv,(2004-04-23),-0.015803648,0.23059285
